    <h4 class="center">Catelyn the Chameleon</h4>
    <p>
     Catelyn Stark's spiritual portrait is quite colorful, reflecting
      her fairly mild preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
     The personalities of people with colorful images have
      a chameleon-like quality, in that they can adapt
      to the people around them more easily than people
      with strong preferences.
     While being able to get along well with a variety of people
      is an advantage of having moderate preferences,
      the flexibility concomitant with slight preferences can
      easily lead to indecisiveness &mdash; which can be a
      distinct disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other chameleons &mdash; people with very slight preferences and hence
      very colorful spiritual portraits &mdash; include

    <h4 class="center">A Passionate and Realistic Mom</h4>
    <p>
     The Red in Catelyn's spiritual portrait represents her passion.
     Catelyn demonstrates her passion for her children early on,
      in the second episode of the series,
      <span class="episode-title">The Kingsroad.</span>&nbsp;
     While watching over her recently-injured, bedridden son Bran.
      an assassin breaks into the room and tries to kill him.
     Catelyn surprises the intruder, immediately gets between
      him and her son, and saves her son's life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Yellow in this spiritual portrait represents Catelyn's realism.
     An example of her pragmatism comes in the seventh episode of season 2,
      <span class="episode-title">A Man Without Honor.</span>&nbsp;
     Her love for her children prompts her to commit treason by
      releasing an infamous prisoner, reviled by soldiers in her son
      Robb's army &mdash; hoping to trade him for her daughters,
      Sansa and Arya.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not just her passion but also Catelyn's realism
      that fueled her decision to betray her son and his soldiers.
     She could see the vengeful soldiers were going to kill the
      prisoner anyway, so she decided to help her daughters rather
      than allow them to have their revenge.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Anguished Mom</h4>
    <p>
     Very colorful image, fairly moderate preferences, this can cause
      internal debates &mdash; or unattainable expectations
    </p>
    <p>
     Example Catelyn's confession to Talisa
    </p>
    <p>
     She feels the gods are punishing her with all the misery
      her family is experiencing because she promised to love
      Jon Snow, but was unable to.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Talisa: May I help you, Lady Stark?<br>
     Catelyn: No.<br>
     Talisa: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have -<br>
     Catelyn: You can't help because a mother makes one for her
     children to protect them.  Only a mother can make them.<br>
     Talisa: You've made them before?<br>
     Catelyn: Twice.<br>
     Talisa: Did they work?<br>
     Catelyn: After a fashion.  I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
       Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.
       Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.
       But it would be a very long night.  So I sat with him all
       through the darkness.  Listened to his ragged little breaths,
       his coughing, his whimpering.<br>
     Talisa: Which boy?<br>
     Catelyn: Jon Snow.  When my husband brought that baby home from the war,
       I couldn't bear to look at him.  I didn't want to see those
       brown stranger's eyes staring up at me.  So I prayed to the gods,
       take him away.  Make him die.  He got the pox.  And I knew I was
       the worst woman who ever lived.  A murderer.  I'd condemned this
       poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous
       of his mother.  A woman he didn't even know.  So I prayed to all
       seven gods, let the boy live.  Let him live and I'll love him.
       I'll be a mother to him.  I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,
       to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.<br>
     Talisa: And he lived.<br>
     Catelyn: And he lived.  And I couldn't keep my promise.  And everything that's
       happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's
       all because I couldn't love a motherless child.<br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Season 3, Episode 2,
      <span class="episode-title">Dark Wings, Dark Words,</span> 2013, 21:26.
