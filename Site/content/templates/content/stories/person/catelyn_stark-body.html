    <h4 class="center">Catelyn the Chameleon</h4>
    <p>
     Catelyn Stark's spiritual portrait is quite colorful, reflecting
      her fairly mild preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
     The personalities of people with colorful images have
      a chameleon-like quality, in that they can adapt
      to the people around them more easily than people
      with strong preferences.
     While being able to get along well with a variety of people
      is an advantage of having moderate preferences,
      the flexibility concomitant with slight preferences can
      easily lead to indecisiveness &mdash; which can be a
      distinct disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other chameleons &mdash; people with very slight preferences and hence
      very colorful spiritual portraits &mdash; include

    <h4 class="center">A Passionate and Realistic Mom</h4>
    <p>
     The Red in Catelyn's spiritual portrait represents her passion.
     Catelyn demonstrates her passion for her children early on,
      in the second episode of the series,
      <span class="episode-title">The Kingsroad.</span>&nbsp;
     While watching over her recently-injured, bedridden son Bran.
      an assassin breaks into the room and tries to kill him.
     Catelyn surprises the intruder, immediately gets between
      him and her son, and saves her son's life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Yellow in this spiritual portrait represents Catelyn's realism.
     An example of her pragmatism comes in the seventh episode of season 2,
      <span class="episode-title">A Man Without Honor.</span>&nbsp;
     Her love for her children prompts her to commit treason by
      releasing an infamous prisoner, reviled by soldiers in her son
      Robb's army &mdash; hoping to trade him for her daughters,
      Sansa and Arya.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not just her passion but also Catelyn's realism
      that fueled her decision to betray her son and his soldiers.
     She could see the vengeful soldiers were going to kill the
      prisoner anyway, so she decided to help her daughters rather
      than allow them to have their revenge.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Anguished Mom</h4>
    <p>
     Happiness is in short supply in the
      <span class="series-title">Game of Thrones</span> universe.
     Like the other characters, Catelyn Stark experiences her fair share
      of frustration and loss.
     Making matters worse, her fairly moderate preferences cause
      her to commit to doing something, only to find it impossible to
      actually do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the second episode of season 3,
      <span class="episode-title">Dark Wings, Dark Words,</span>&nbsp;
      Catelyn confesses to her daugher-in-law that she feels responsible
      for all the misery her family has been experiencing.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Catelyn: [O]ne of the boys came down with the pox.
       Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.
       But it would be a very long night.  So I sat with him all
       through the darkness.  Listened to his ragged little breaths,
       his coughing, his whimpering.<br>
     Talisa: Which boy?<br>
     Catelyn: Jon Snow.  When my husband brought that baby home from the war,
       I couldn't bear to look at him.  I didn't want to see those
       brown stranger's eyes staring up at me.  So I prayed to the gods,
       take him away.  Make him die.  He got the pox.  And I knew I was
       the worst woman who ever lived.  A murderer.  I'd condemned this
       poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous
       of his mother.  A woman he didn't even know.  So I prayed to all
       seven gods, let the boy live.  Let him live and I'll love him.
       I'll be a mother to him.  I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,
       to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.<br>
     Talisa: And he lived.<br>
     Catelyn: And he lived.  And I couldn't keep my promise.  And everything that's
       happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's
       all because I couldn't love a motherless child.<br>

      famously observed,
      <q class="">facts are stubborn things.</q>
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">A Remarkable Revelation</h5>
    <p>
     This is a truly remarkable revelation.
     Catelyn Stark feels the gods are punishing her and her family
      because she promised the gods she would love her
      husband's bastard son Jon Snow, then found she was unable to.
    </p>
    <p>
     As someone with mild preferences, Catelyn has the objectivity (Green)
      needed to know Jon did not choose to have another woman as
      his mother.
     She also has the insight (Blue) needed to see Jon will need her
      love if he is to survive the harsh environment of
      George R. R. Martin's Westeros.
     So in a time of stress she makes a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Jon survives his illness, Catelyn discovers her emotions (Red)
      overrule her objectivity, and her pragmatism (Yellow) trumps her
      insight &mdash; and she is unable to keep the promise she made.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
     Catelyn <u>knows</u> Jon needs a mother's love.
     She <u>knows</u> it is not Jon's fault his father committed
      adultery &mdash; and she can <u>embrace the idea</u>
      that she can love him regardless of Ned's infidelity.
     <br>
     But she cannot escape the <u>rage she feels</u> about Ned's
      adultery &mdash; and she cannot ignore the <u>fact</u>
      that Jon is a constant reminder of it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     The people of Westeros experience all sorts of agony, and
      many are satisfied with a quick death rather than a slow one.
    Catelyn experiences a grief incomprehensible to the typical
     cold-hearted Westerosi, and it's easy for observers to
     see it is entirely &mdash; albeit subconsciously &mdash; self-inflicted.

       Catelyn Stark's spiritual portrait and
        the image of her husband Ned's personality
        are strikingly similar.
       Catelyn is more outgoing than her husband, but
        otherwise they are nearly identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both images are colorful, indicating they are chameleons,
        yet both also exude a powerful warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Catelyn, Ned has a soft spot for children.
       Before the series starts he agrees to adopt rather than
        murder the traitorous Beylon Greyjoy's son Theon.
       Then while serving as Hand, he has a falling out with his
        good friend

     Like Catelyn, Ned learns the hard way that having compassion for
      others can be a serious liability in Westeros.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
     &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
     I like to think of myself as being a compassionate person, and
      find it easy to relate to Catelyn and Ned.
     And I am certainly glad to live in modern-day America
      rather than in George R. R. Martin's brutal Westeros!
