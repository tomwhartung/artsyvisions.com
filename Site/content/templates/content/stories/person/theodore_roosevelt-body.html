     Both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt are ESTJs, but there are some
      subtle yet important differences in their personalities.
    </p>
    <h4>TR: More Emotional Than FDR</h4>
    <p>
     There is more Red in Theodore's spiritual portrait than there is in his

       cousin FDR's image</a>.
     This is because TR's personality profile is more decisive and
      emotional &mdash; less <em>Thinking</em> &mdash; than his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Above all, Theodore admired &mdash; and demonstrated &mdash; courage.
    <blockquote>
     It is not the critic who counts. ... The credit belongs to the man
      who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and
      sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ... who, at worst,
      if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place
      shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know
      neither victory or defeat.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     While campaigning for president in 1912, a man shot Theodore,
      but TR carried on and delived the 90-minute speech he had planned nonetheless.
     Doctors later learned what TR already knew &mdash; that there was no
      damage to his lung &mdash; and decided it would be preferable to leave
      the bullet inside his chest.

      Theodore Roosevelt carried a bullet inside his body for
      the rest of his life.
    </p>
    <h4>Plenty of Similarities</h4>
    <p>
     Although they belonged to different political parties &mdash; TR was a
      Republican and FDR a Democrat &mdash; both were concerned that the
      concentration of wealth in the hands of a few could lead to the
      exploitation of average citizens:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on the contrary, these
      big aggregations are an inevitable development of modern industrialism. ...
     We are not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall be
      so handled as to subserve the public good.
     We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     And both Presidents Roosevelt experienced a great deal of physical pain
      their final years, dying while still fairly young, in their early 60s.
     Quoting from his autobiography, published in 1913, it is plain he
      had no regrets:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks,
      and the greatest of all prizes are those connected with the home.
     No father and mother can hope to escape sorrow and anxiety,
      and there are dreadful moments when death comes very near those we love,
      even if for the time being it passes by.
     But life is a great adventure, and the worst of all fears is the
      fear of living.
