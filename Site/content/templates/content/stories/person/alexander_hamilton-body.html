      Alexander Hamilton</a>
      was born illegitimately on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in
      Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis
      in the Caribbean Sea.
     He was the youngest of the seven <q>key</q>&nbsp;Founding Fathers and the
      only one of that group who was born outside of the Thirteen Colonies.
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Decision Maker</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Green in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his strong preference for being rational and decisive.
     He demonstrated courage and conviction during the Revolutionary
      War, and his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to
      pursue a career in law.
     </p>
     <p>
     As a youth, Hamilton was unable to attend school at the Church of England
      because his parents were unmarried.
     However, he received some tutoring at a private school which he
      was able to supplement with reading his family's books.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton came to America in 1772 &mdash; while he was still
      a teenager &mdash; and after a year or so began studying at
      King's College, now Columbia University.
     While there he learned about and joined the patriots' revolutionary cause,
      and during the Revolutionary War he served as one of

      aides de camp for four years.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Realist</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his realism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton's desire for a strong federal government backed by a
      standing army is an excellent example of his pragmatism.
     As Washington's aide during the Revolutionary War,
      Hamilton had seen first hand how the lack of
      essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the
      soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.
     America won the war in 1783, but wound up deeply in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Years later, Shay's Rebellion threatened the lives of Americans
      in 1786 and 1787, but by that time the
      country's standing army was miniscule.
     There was not even a plan to repay the debt for the Revolutionary War,
      much less pay for new men and munitions, and
      Hamilton the realist saw it would be very difficult to find new recruits.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to
      our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be,
      we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the
      ambition of others.

        Concerning the General Power of Taxation,</span>
     January 4, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     As a realist, Hamilton found himself at odds with the idealistic
      Thomas Jefferson, who believed America had no enemies and
      hence did not need an army.

      <q class="dialog">hated each

    <h4 class="center">America's First Political Parties</h4>
    <p>
     Having won the Revolutionary War, the stoic George Washington was
      immensely popular.
     He was elected unanimously to two terms as the
      1<span class="ordinal">st</span> President of the United States, and
      Washington remains the only president who was
      <em><u>not</u></em> a member of a political party.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1797, when Washington's second term came to an end and he refused to
      serve for a third, the politicians in the new country gradually
      began wanting to play a greater role in the new nation.
     Political rivalry and a touch of ambition &mdash; which the
      Founding Fathers were careful to keep under wraps,
      because humilty was very <q class="slang">in</q>&nbsp; back
      then &mdash; soon enhanced Hamilton's and Jefferson's
      personal differences, bringing them to the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Federalist Papers, Hamilton succinctly observes
      how differences in background and opinion can ultimately
      lead to a stubbornness that can preclude rational decisionmaking:
    </p>
    <blockquote class='avs-blockquote'>
     Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no
      agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned
      by those whom they dislike.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
      <span class="document-title">Federalist No. 70,
       The Executive Department Further Considered,</span>
      March 18, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Some of the differences between Hamilton and Jefferson are visible
      only in the spiritual portraits of them here and on
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com'
         title='Link to the Home page of SeeOurMinds.com' target="_blank">
       SeeOurMinds.com</a>.
     Eventually these previously invisible differences combined with the
      more superficial, demographic differences of background, occupation, age,
      place of residence, etc. and led to the formation of America's
      first political parties.

      and other Founding Fathers may have been political rivals, but
      they were also predominantly logical
      people.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
     Significantly, they may have disagreed over many things but they
      were all strongly united in their disdain for the sort of
      uncontrolled emotions that could fuel mob violence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having taken the time to analyze and draw their personalities,
      I am convinced the idea that any of the Founding Fathers
      <q class="dialog">hated each
      other</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
