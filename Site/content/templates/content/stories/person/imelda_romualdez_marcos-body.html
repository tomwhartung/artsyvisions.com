     This spiritual portrait of Imelda Marcos, the infamous First Lady
      of the Philippines, reflects her fairly strong preferences for
      ideas (over facts) and emotion (over logic) with ample amounts of
      Blue and Red, and much less Yellow and Green.</p>
    <h4 class="center"><q>Beauty Is God and Love Made Real</q></h4>
    <p>
     It may seem surprising that someone who put so much emphasis on
      beauty &mdash; ostensibly a surface quality &mdash; would be an idealist.
     It turns out that Imelda actually equates beauty with god and love:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     It is not expensive to be beautiful.  It takes only a little effort,
      to be presentable, and beautiful.  But, it takes some effort.  And E
      for effort.  And unfortunately, people think of beauty as luxury;
      of beauty as frivolity, no!  Or extravagant.  Beauty is a discipline.
     Beauty is art, is harmony, in the ideological sense.  And in the
      theological sense beauty is god and love made real.

    <p>
     Given her point of view, it's easy to see how Imelda's obsession
      with appearances in general and shoes &mdash;
      <q>I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes,
       I had one thousand and sixty.</q>
      &mdash; in particular is based on idealism.
     And from her point of view this infatuation is based not on selfishness
      but on her concern for the poor, <q>little</q> people in her country.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios,
      I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star.
     Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing housedresses
      and slippers. That's not what people want to see.
     People want someone they can love, someone to set an example.

    <blockquote>
     All the things that you see around you, they become the elements of
      your infrastructure.  But they can only be good as they are beautiful,
      and beauty is in the landscape of your heart.  Do not leave it there.
     Paint it, shape it, build it, let it flow from within you, in everything
      you do or touch.  It is easy to be beautiful, because it is magical.

     Given her apparently gentle and caring nature, it's rather difficult
      to believe that her husband, Ferdinand Marcos,
      ruled the Philippines as president from 1966 through 1986.
     This period includes the time he spent as dictator, starting in 1972
      after he declared martial law and running for almost ten years &mdash;
      amid accusations of human rights abuses
      such as abductions, torture, and murder.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Idealistic Interpretations</h4>
    <p>
     Thanks to Imelda's idealistic viewpoint, she can have her own
      interpretation of these events.
     For example, in the movie she has this to say about the assassination
      of her husband's political rival Benigno Aquino Jr.  in 1983:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The events have proven that we, the Marcoses, Ferdinand and Imelda,
      were ultimately the victims in the assassination of
      [Senator Benigno <q>Ninoy</q>] Aquino [Jr.].

    </blockquote>
    <p>
     That seems to be stretching things a bit &mdash; considering the
      Marcoses were the ones who survived the hail of bullets!
     But what can one expect from someone who uses her own name to create
      a word &mdash; <q>Imeldific</q>
      &mdash; to describe herself?
    </p>
    <p>
     Imelda Marcos is a colorful individual who is also surprisingly deep,
      and her spiritual portrait reflects that.
     It's good that much of the

      about her features her talking about herself in her own words &mdash;
      so that viewers do not have to rely on a third party description of
      this incredible and very unique woman!
