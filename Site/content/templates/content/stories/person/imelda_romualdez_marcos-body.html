      depicting the personality of
      <a href="https://SeeOurMinds.com/image/0800-real-famous-world-famous/0806/"
         title="Spiritual Portrait of Imelda Marcos on SeeOurMinds.com"
         target="_blank">
       Imelda Marcos</a>,
      the wife of Ferdinand Marcos, President of the Philipines for
      over twenty years.
     For almost half of this time the country was under martial law,
      making Ferdinand essentially its dictator.
    </p>
    <p>
     Imelda was famous for her large collection of shoes,
      made more exceptional by the poverty in which much of
      the country lived.
     Does her spiritual portrait hold some explanation for this
      unseemly behavior?
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Deep and Passionate</h4>
    <p>
     This image shows Imelda has fairly strong preferences.
     In particular, she's not very logical and prone to seeing
      many possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue reflects Imelda's tendency to give more weight to
      ideas than to facts, and
      the Red shows she has a tendency to be more personal
      than objective.
     Like her spiritual portrait, she is deep &mdash; there's more
      to her than meets the eye &mdash; and
      passionate about life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right away this image makes it clear greed is Imelda's motive, nor
      is she interested in the superficial.
     If greed or simply looking good were her goals,
      she'd be more logical and pragmatic, and her image would
      contain much more Yellow and Green.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center"><q>Beauty Is God and Love Made Real</q></h4>
    <p>
     As First Lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos felt it was her
      duty to be beautiful.
     She shows how emphasizing beauty &mdash; which may
      seems like a totally surface quality &mdash; is quite
      compatible with being deeply idealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
     From Imelda's idealistic viewpoint beauty, god, and
      love are all closely related:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     It is not expensive to be beautiful.  It takes only a little effort,
      to be presentable, and beautiful.  But, it takes some effort.  And E
      for effort.  And unfortunately, people think of beauty as luxury;
      of beauty as frivolity, no!  Or extravagant.  Beauty is a discipline.
     Beauty is art, is harmony, in the ideological sense.  And in the
      theological sense beauty is god and love made real.

    <p>
     Given Imelda's point of view, it's easy to see how her obsession
      with appearances in general and
      shoes<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in particular is based on idealism.
     As far as she is concerned, her infatuation is based not on selfishness,
      but on her concern for the poor,
      <q class="expression">little people</q>&nbsp; in her country.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Circles of Life</h4>
    <p>
     The movie about her life,
      <a href='{{ afl_content.im_video }}' class="movie-title" target='_blank'>
       Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>,
      was directed by
       Ramona S. Diaz
      and is an enjoyable and enlightening view
      of her before, during, and after her time
      as First Lady of the Philippines.
     It includes a scene in which she reads from her book &mdash; a book
      she introduces with a bit of humility.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the movie she reads the
      following quote from her book,
      <q class="book-title">Circles of Life</q>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     All the things that you see around you, they become the elements of
      your infrastructure.  But they can only be good as they are beautiful,
      and beauty is in the landscape of your heart.  Do not leave it there.
     Paint it, shape it, build it, let it flow from within you, in everything
      you do or touch.  It is easy to be beautiful, because it is magical.
     <br />
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Quoted from
     <q class="book-title">Circles of Life</q>
     by Imelda Marcos in the movie
     <a href='{{ afl_content.im_video }}' class="movie-title" target='_blank'>
      Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>,
     2003.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Given Imelda's gentle and caring nature, it's difficult
      to conceive how her husband ruled the Philippines as a
      dictator for almost a decade.
     Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972.
     It lasted for almost ten years &mdash; a time during which
      he faced accusations of human rights abuses
      such as abductions, torture, and murder.

     Imelda Marcos is a colorful individual who is also surprisingly deep,
      and her spiritual portrait reflects that.
     It's good that much of the
      <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/'
         title='Page for the movie Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>
       movie</a>
      about her features her talking about herself in her own words &mdash;
      so that viewers do not have to rely on a third party description of
      this incredible and very unique woman!

     This spiritual portrait is based mainly on the movie about
      Imelda Marcos' life,

     I thoroughly enjoyed this watching movie and
      learning about Imelda's motivations &mdash;
      and hope you will enjoy it as well &mdash;
      but realize it is probably not for everyone.
