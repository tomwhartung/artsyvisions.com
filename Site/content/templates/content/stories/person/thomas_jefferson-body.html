     After having worked out the Compromise of 1790 with James Madison and

         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'
         target="_blank">
       Alexander Hamilton</a>,
      on March 4, 1801 Jefferson became the 1<span class="ordinal">st</span>
      president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Ideally: Liberty Without Anarchy</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Blue in Jefferson's profile represents his
      strong preference for being idealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1777 Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious
      Freedom, which granted religious freedom to people of all faiths.
     The statute paved the way for clauses in the
      1<span class="ordinal">st</span> Ammendment to the Constitution
      that grants religious freedom to all Americans, and
      is an excellent example of his idealism.
    </p>
    <p>
     As this quote shows, Jefferson's idealism also enabled him to
      delineate the fine yet crucial distinction between too much
      liberty &mdash; total anarchy &mdash; and just enough:</p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is
      unobstructed action according to our will.
     But <b>rightful liberty is</b> unobstructed action according to our will
      <b>within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others.</b>&nbsp;
     [Emphasis added.]
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson, in a Letter to Isaac H. Tiffany,
      April 4, 1819.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Without the qualifier calling for
      <q class="from-document">limits drawn around us by the equal
       rights of others,</q>
      the American Revolution may have wound up
      just trading one form of tyranny for another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jefferson's idealism helped make the transition to the United
      States' new and unique system of government, once independence
      from Britain was attained, relatively peaceful.
     In contrast, the transitions of some other countries since then &mdash;
      from France's Reign of Terror to more recent conflicts such as the
      Arab Spring &mdash; have been quite the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Americans are fortunate to have individuals such as
      Jefferson who are willing to express their ideals and
      do the work required to see them brought to reality.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Balancing Head and Heart</h4>
    <p>
     Thomas Jefferson's tendency to be more logical than passionate is
      visible in the image as Green.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is important to note this preference is very slight, but
      because his preference for being open-minded is so much
      stronger than his preference for being decisive, it is difficult to
      see this in the image.
     In other words, because there is so much more Blue and Yellow in
      his portrait than there is Green and Red, it is difficult to see
      the Red and Green appear in roughly the same
      amounts.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jefferson's ability to balance rational with emotional decision-making
      is most apparent in a letter he wrote to Maria Cosway
      in the spring of 1786.
     The letter articulates &mdash; in an extremely personal and revealing
      manner &mdash; the battle being fought in his mind between his head and his
      heart:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head &amp; my Heart:
     <br>
     Head: Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.
     <br>
     Heart: I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings.  Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.
     <br>
     Head: These are the eternal consequences of your warmth &amp; precipitation.  This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us....
     <br>
     Heart: Oh, my friend! This is no moment to upbraid my foibles.  I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief! ....
     <br>
     Head: On the contrary I never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions....  Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer it....
     <br>
     Heart: Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings.  It was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it....
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Excerpts from <q class="document-title">My Head and My Heart,</q>
      a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, October 12,
      1786.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     In this short passage, Thomas Jefferson
      shows he took advantage of both decision-making techniques.
     This explains why some consider him an enigma &mdash;
      in that he could declare
      <q class="from-book">all men are created equal,</q>&nbsp;
      while owning slaves and even
      loving<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>

     Some people claim that Jefferson and Hamilton
      <q class="dialog">hated each

    <h4 class="center">America's First Political Parties</h4>
    <p>
     Having won the Revolutionary War, the stoic George Washington was
      immensely popular.
     He was elected unanimously to two terms as the
      1<span class="ordinal">st</span> President of the United States, and
      Washington remains the only president who was
      <em><u>not</u></em> a member of a political party.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1797, when Washington's second term came to an end and he refused to
      serve for a third, the politicians in the new country gradually
      began wanting to play a greater role in the new nation.
     Political rivalry and a touch of ambition &mdash; which the
      Founding Fathers were careful to keep under wraps,
      because humilty was very <q class="slang">in</q>&nbsp; back
      then &mdash; soon enhanced Hamilton's and Jefferson's
      personal differences, bringing them to the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton succinctly observes
      how differences in background and opinion can ultimately
      lead to a stubbornness that can preclude rational decisionmaking:
    </p>
    <blockquote class='avs-blockquote'>
     Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no
      agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned
      by those whom they dislike.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
      <span class="document-title">Federalist No. 70,
       The Executive Department Further Considered,</span>
      March 18, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Some of the differences between Jefferson and Hamilton are visible
      only in the spiritual portraits of them here and on
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com'
         title='Link to the Home page of SeeOurMinds.com' target="_blank">
       SeeOurMinds.com</a>.
     Eventually these previously invisible differences combined with the
      more superficial, demographic differences of background, occupation, age,
      place of residence, etc. and led to the formation of America's
      first political parties.

      and other Founding Fathers may have been political rivals, but
      they were also predominantly logical

     Significantly, they may have disagreed over many things but they
      were all strongly united in their disdain for the sort of
      uncontrolled emotions that could fuel mob violence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having taken the time to analyze and draw their personalities,
      I am convinced the idea that any of the Founding Fathers
