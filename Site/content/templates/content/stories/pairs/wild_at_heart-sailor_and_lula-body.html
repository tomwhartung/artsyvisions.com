     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
	    They depict the personalities of Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune, the
      main characters in the film
						<a href="{{ afl_content.wild_at_heart }}" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
       Wild at Heart</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     David Lynch
      wrote the screenplay and directed the film, basing it on the
						<a href="{{ afl_content.wild_heart_book }}" target="_blank">
       novel by Barry Gifford</a>.
     These images show that both Sailor and Lula
      are open-minded and passionate.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Opening With a Bang</h4>
    <p>
     Released on August 17<span classs="ordinal">th</span>, 1991,
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span>
      opens with a violent <em><u>bang</u></em> that sets the tone
      for the rest of the film.
    </p>
    <p>
     Admittedly a bit brutal in his defense of himself,
      Sailor Ripley is nonetheless more of a victim than a perpetrator.
     He quickly pays his debt to society and the film starts in
      earnest when Lula picks him up at the
      Pee Dee Correctional Institution.
     Without further ado, the couple puts all the
      ugliness behind them and rides off in Lula's
      black Thunderbird convertible to see their favorite band,
      the speed-metal group <em>Powermad</em> &mdash; at the Hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their happiness at being reunited is palpable, and they
      seem ready to finally enjoy their life together.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">A Sweet Couple</h5>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Yellow and Blue in their spiritual portraits
      shows Sailor and Lula are a very sweet couple.
     They bear no one any ill will &mdash;
      provided others respect them and their relationship &mdash;
      and are open to just about everyone and anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lula and Sailor truly enjoy life in each others'
      company, and they spend their time chatting about the past
      rather than planning for the future.
     When it comes time to be decisive, their strong
      feelings for each other dominate the decisions they make.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their innocence and passion make it easy for anyone
      who has ever been young and in love to relate to them.
     Unfortunately, if Marietta Fortune was ever young and
      in love, it must have been so long ago that she has
      completely forgotten that blissful feeling.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">A Determined Mom</h5>
    <p>
     What Sailor and Lula lack in decision-making ability is
      more than made up for by Lula's mom Marietta.
    </p>
    <p>
     For reasons revealed as the film progresses, Marietta
      has become obsessed with keeping Lula away from Sailor.
     As a young woman who is hopelessly and completely in
      love, Lula demonstrates time and again she has
      absolutely no intention of cooperating with her
      domineering mom, regardless of her mom's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's impossible to create Marietta Fortune's
      spiritual portrait with confidence, because her
      character is not very well developed in the film.
     However, it's clear that passion dominates her personality.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there was a way to get to know Marietta better,
      an image of her personality would certainly be full of Red.
     She rarely demonstrates any openness towards anyone,
      except superficially, such as when it comes time to manipulate
      a hapless accomplice.
     Certainly the way Lynch uses Red as a motif throughout
      the film &mdash; particularly in scenes relating to
      Marietta &mdash; is more synchronicity than coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blinded by her prejudice, Marietta cannot see that Lula and
      Sailor just want to be left alone.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Wild Love &mdash; In Hell</h4>
    <p>
     The relationship between Sailor and Lula is an excellent
      example of <q class="foreign-term">amour fou,</q>&nbsp;
      French for <q class="italic">insane love.</q>&nbsp;
     Precedents for a couple in love fleeing authoritarian
      figures appear in the 1950 film noir
      <span class="movie-title">Guncrazy</span>, and
      the famous gangster film, 1967's
      <span class="movie-title">Bonnie and Clyde.</span>
     Despite the similarity on the surface, the
      <span class="foreign-term">amour fou</span> in
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span> is
      far from being derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one thing, Lula and Sailor are comparatively innocent:
      Sailor has fully paid the price for being a
      <q class="slang">manslaughterer,</q> and Lula is
      guilty only of being passionately in love with a man whom
      her mom refuses to accept.
     For another, in their attempt to escape Marietta's intolerance,
      Lula and Sailor find themselves traveling through Hell.

      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span>

         class="document-title" target="_blank">
       Weirdsville USA: The Obsessive Universe of David Lynch,</a>
      by Paul A. Woods.
     Published in 2000, the book has a chapter covering
      each of Lynch's most popular early films, starting with
       Eraserhead
      in 1977 and ending with 1999's
       Mulholland Drive
     The chapter
      <span class="document-title">Wild at Heart: Lynch Mob Rules</span>
      appears sandwiched between the two chapters &mdash; one for each
      season &mdash; in the book for
						<a href="{{ afl_content.twin_peaks }}" class="series-title" target="_blank">
       Twin Peaks</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     In <span class="document-title">Weirdsville USA</span>,
      Paul A. Woods reveals what the director had to say about
      the film's <q class="from-book">big theme:</q>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     For those who were looking for the big theme,
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span> was,
      Lynch assured them,
      <q class="from-book underline">... about finding love in Hell.</q>
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;David Lynch, quoted in
      <span class="book-title">Weirdsville USA</span> by
      Paul A. Woods, 2000, p.116.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     This one bit of insight helps explain some of the
      seemingly unrelated and otherwise anomalous scenes in the film,
      such as an apparently random automobile accident and Lula's
      frustration at not being able to find a suitable radio station.
     Lynch's <q class="mantra">big theme</q> also explains the
      frequent vignettes of fire in the film, including the
      innumerable close-ups of recently-lit matches
      which frequently fill the entire screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     For fans of David Lynch, <span class="book-title">Weirdsville USA</span>
      is an enlightening source of inside information like this.
     One interesting tidbit from the book is the fact that Lynch wrote
      the screenplay in just a week.
     Another is that
      Diane Ladd &mdash; who plays Lula's mom Marietta, and
      Laura Dern &mdash; who plays Lula,
      are mother and daughter in real life.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">The Road Trip</h5>
    <p>
     If Sailor and Lula were more decisive people &mdash;
      if their spiritual portraits had more Green and Red, like the images of
      <a href="/visions/story/0060-person-alexander_hamilton"
         title="Article about Alexander Hamilton on this site" target="_blank">
       Alexander Hamilton</a>'s or

         title="Article about Agent Dana Scully on this site" target="_blank">
       Agent Dana Scully</a>'s
      personas, for example &mdash; maybe they would have
      stood up to Marietta.
     But their personalities are more open and free,
      so they go on a road trip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although they're in a car traveling west in America,
      Lynch makes their journey less like Jack Kerouac's
      <span class="book-title">On the Road</span> and more like
      <span class="book-title">The Wizard of Oz</span>.
     This rather odd touch contributes to the surrealism
      that pervades the film.
    </p>
    <p>
     The net result is a wild ride full of unique, interesting characters.
     This film is not for everyone, but it offers a fun diversion for
      the more open-minded among us. who will find it easier to relate
      to the protagonists.

     These spiritual portraits are based on the characters Sailor Ripley
      and Lula Fortune as they appear in the film
						<a href="{{ afl_content.wild_at_heart }}" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
       Wild at Heart</a>
      by
       David Lynch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lynch was able to complete the film in time to enter it in
      the Cannes Film Festival.
     There it won the <span class="foreign-term">Palme d'Or</span>&nbsp;
      or <q class="italic">Golden Palm</q> &mdash; the highest
      award granted at the festival.
     Unfortunately, when it was released publicly in August of 1990
      &mdash; as Paul A. Woods puts it in his book &mdash;
      <q class="from-book"><span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span>
       did poorly at the box office.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately following this, Woods offers the following
      explanatory quote, once again giving fans insight into
      Lynch's motivations and how he sees his critics:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     <q>Not everybody loves what you've done,</q>
     Lynch conceeded understatedly,
     "and negativity can be a powerful thing.
      And even the positive things are upsetting in a way
       because then you want to please the next time again.
      You gotta kinda just think about the work
       but it's not always easy.
     <br>
     <q>I can't try to second-guess the critics.
      The world is changing and we are changing within it.
      As soon as you think you've got something figured out,
       it's different.
      That is what I try to do.
      I don't try to do anything new, or weird, or David Lynch.
      But I'm real happy with the picture.
      See, I love 47 different genres in one film.
      I hate one-thing films.
      And I love B-movies.
      But why not have four or five Bs running together?
      Like a little hive!</q>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;David Lynch, quoted in
       <span class="book-title">Weirdsville USA</span> by
       Paul A. Woods, 2000, p.128.

    <p>
     Lynch's previous film,
       Blue Velvet,
      appeared in 1986 and the first season of
						<a href="{{ afl_content.twin_peaks }}" class="series-title" target="_blank">
       Twin Peaks</a>
      had just aired in April and May of 1990.
     When <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span> hit the theaters
      on August 17, 1990, it's possible many Americans were expecting
      something more like his other work during that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today the film is close to thirty years old, and I for one
      believe it has withstood the test of time.
