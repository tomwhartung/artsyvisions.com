     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of Dr. McCoy and
      Mr. Spock from the
      <a href="{{ afl_content.star_trek_tos }}" target="_blank"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Spock and McCoy</h4>
    <p>
     As a half-human and half-Vulcan Chief Science Officer,
      Mr. Spock uses logic to suppress his emotions.
     As the starship's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. McCoy is more knowledgeable
      about people than things.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two are archetypal characters on a classic show, and they
      demonstrate a powerful dichotomy in the human psyche.
     The contrast between these images shows a fundamental difference in
      the way people make decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Green in Mr. Spock's spiritual portrait depicts his preference
      for making logical decisions.
     He is highly intelligent, and has dedicated his life to understanding
      science and knowing how machines work.
     Spock’s cool, calm mantra is <q class="mantra">It’s logical.</q>
     As one of
      <a href="/visions/story/0010-person-captain_kirk"
         title="Article about Captain James T. Kirk on this site">
       Captain James T. Kirk</a>’s
      most trusted advisors, he functions as the Enterprise’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red in Dr. Leonard McCoy's spiritual portrait depicts his
       preference for making emotional decisions.
     He is passionate and has dedicated his life to working with and
      healing people.
     McCoy’s heated, passionate mantra is
      <q class="mantra">I'm not a [fill in the blank], I'm a doctor!</q>
     As another of Kirk’s most trusted advisors, he functions as
      the Enterprise’s heart.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Green and Red</h4>
    <p>
     The decision to use Green to represent what Carl Jung called the
      <span class="mental-function">Thinking</span>
      mental function was a no-brainer.
     As the painter Wassily Kandinsky observed,
      <q class="from-book">Green is the most restful
      color, lacking any undertone of joy, grief, or
      passion.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
     It is the color of chlorophyll and hence the color of plants, which are
      necessary to support life as we know it on the planet.
     </p>
     <p>
     Green is the color of Mr. Spock’s blood and, in American culture,
      it is the color of money.
     Is it mere coincidence it is the color associated with the cold logic of
      Saint Patrick’s day, <em>if</em> you don’t wear Green,
      <em>then</em> you will get pinched?
    </p>
    <p>
     Most importantly &mdash; at least when it comes to visualizing
      personalities &mdash; Green is the opposite of Red.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is likewise only natural to choose Red to represent what Carl Jung
      called the <span class="mental-function">Feeling</span> mental function.
     Red conveys warmth, and is the color of fire and blood, of the
      heart and of love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Red is the color of the passion we feel for someone, regardless of
      whether it is someone we hate or someone we love.
     It makes us feel warm, as blood flows increase and prepare
      us for fight, flight, or love-making.
     In our culture it also happens to be the color of Valentine’s Day and
      the “red-light” districts, where people can exchange cool, Green money
      for warm, Red <q class="slang">love.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Head and Heart</h4>
    <p>
     Mr. Spock exemplifies the cool, calm, rationality of logical
      decision-making, and his spiritual portrait reflects this with its
      massive amount of Green.
     Spock's image also contains some little bits of Red, reflecting
      how he does have some emotions.
     Due to his Vulcan heritage and upbringing, though,
      he does his best to keep these emotions to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Captain Kirk's First Officer and Chief Science Officer,
      Spock knows about and is responsible for
      all of the starship's essential systems.
     Spock is the head of the Starship Enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. McCoy likewise exemplifies the warm, fiery, passion of emotional
      decision-making, and his spiritual portrait reflects this with its
      ample amounts of Red.
     His image contains very little Green, indicating his preference for
      the emotion of humans is as strong as
      Spock’s preference for the logic of the Vulcans &mdash; if not stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Chief Medical Officer, McCoy knows about and is responsible for
      the health and well-being of all of the starship's personnel.
     McCoy is the heart of the Starship Enterprise.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">What They Share</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in both Dr. McCoy's and Mr. Spock's portraits represents
      how both of them share a preference for pragmatism.
     This helps them work well together despite their differences.
     They tend to see things the same way, they just frequently differ on
      what to do about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although much is made of the differences between Spock and McCoy,
      they share some important goals,
      such as the desire for peace rather than violence.
     They both show concern for others, and implicitly seek to understand and
      appreciate alien cultures rather than conquer them.
     It's easy to take these commonalities for
      granted when everyone on the ship &mdash; and many in the
      audience &mdash; implicity holds similar values.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps most importantly, both McCoy and Spock work for, and
      are friends with, the same boss:
      <a href="/visions/story/0010-person-captain_kirk"
         title="Article about Captain James T. Kirk on this site">
       James T. Kirk</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Working Together</h4>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk is wise to seek the advice of two people who have
      such different temperaments.
     As a leader, he frequently sides with Mr. Spock, because often the
      logical thing to do is indeed the best thing to do.
     But Kirk also values Dr. McCoy's opinions, and he always considers
      the lives of his crew to be more important than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon after the
      <a href="{{ afl_content.star_trek_tos }}" target="_blank"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series began airing, viewers
      responded very positively to Mr. Spock’s character.
     Spock's popularity is fueled by his conflicts with McCoy in episodes
      such as <span class="episode-title">The Galileo Seven</span>,
      in which the pair and several others get stranded on a planet in a
      shuttlecraft.
     This is because many of us feel this conflict between logic
      and emotion within ourselves, in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock personalize the inner conflict many of
      us feel.
     Watching these two opposing characters voice their opposing views and
      find a way to resolve them gives viewers a model for resolving our
      own inner conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this light, McCoy's and Spock's fictional relationship is
      similar to the

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     These portraits are based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="{{ afl_content.star_trek_tos }}" target="_blank"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, and a new recording of the theme using the
      original score &mdash; both reworked using the latest technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      special effects sequences while watching an episode.

     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
     Show creator Gene Roddenberry makes an appearance in some of the
      special features, and they include segments about what the main
      players are doing in their later lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects and with some of the writers for the
      series &mdash; such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana,
      writer<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
      and script consultant for the series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to watch
      the episodes again, in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
