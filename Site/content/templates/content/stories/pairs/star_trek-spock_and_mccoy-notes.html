   A spiritual portrait or <em>Groja</em> &mdash; for
    <strong><u>G</u></strong>raphical <strong><u>R</u></strong>epresentation
    <strong><u>o</u></strong>f <strong><u>J</u></strong>ungian
    <strong><u>A</u></strong>rchetypes &mdash; is an image representing
    the personality of a person.
   Inspired by the abstract art of Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky,
    Grojas seek to demonstrate harmony in rectangular shapes of
    opposing primary colors.
   The colors in the Grojas depict the pairs of opposing personality
    functions Carl Jung detailed in his writings about psychological
    types in the early 1920s.

   Something about the way D. C. Fontana
    speaks makes me want to figure out some way to draw her
    spiritual portrait.
   Perhaps I will reach out to her someday and politely ask whether she'd
    be interested in something like this!
