     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of Bob Marley, a central figure in Reggae music, and
      Jesus Christ, <i>the</i> central figure in the Christian religion.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">xNFx: Blue and Red</h4>
    <p>
     Both images contain a lot of Blue and Red, because both Bob and Jesus tend to be idealistic and compassionate.
    </p>
    <p>
     In terms of the four-letter types made popular by the MBTI&reg;, both are <b>xNFx</b> &mdash;
      indicating both of them exhibit Carl Jung's i<b>N</b>tuition and <b>F</b>eeling personality traits.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Blue &mdash; i<b>N</b>tuition</h5>
    <p>
     The <b>Blue</b> in these images represents the trait Jung calls i<b>N</b>tuition.
     A person who is high in i<b>N</b>tuition tends to see things and events more in terms of ideas than facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Bob and Jesus were different in many ways, the <b>idea of God</b> plays a major role in both of their lives.
     Bob uses the term <q class="expression">Jah</q> rather than <q class="expression">God</q> in songs such as
      <q class="song-title">Forever Loving Jah</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      and <q class="song-title">Rastaman Vibration</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>,
      but in my mind he and Jesus embrace the same <b>idea</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
     As far as I'm concerned, anyone who asserts there is a significant difference between God and Jah is just being
      disagreeable &mdash; and unnecessarily defensive and divisive.
    </p>
    <p>
     This <b>idea</b> that a higher power exists is one reason they are more <b>idealistic</b> than realistic.
     Now, this does not mean that everyone who is i<b>N</b>tuitive believes in Jah or God or Allah or the
      Seven Gods of Westeros, only that more pragmatic people tend to doubt the existance of something they
      cannot see, hear, touch, smell, or taste.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Red &mdash; <b>F</b>eeling</h5>
    <p>
     The <b>Red</b> in these images represents the trait Jung and the MBTI call <b>F</b>eeling.
     A person who is high in <b>F</b>eeling tends to be more emotional than logical, and tends to prefer working with
      other people rather than with inanimate things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Bob and Jesus were compassionate and cared a lot about other people.
     While Jesus demonstrated his compassion by healing the sick, Bob makes his tendency in this respect clear in songs like
      <q class="song-title">Jammin',</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he claims <q class="lyrics">life is worth much more than gold.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Bob lacked Jesus' ability to perform miracles, he sought to comfort people with songs such as
      <q class="song-title">Three Little Birds,</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he sings that <q class="lyrics">every little thing gonna be alright</q> and
      <q class="song-title">Johnny Was,</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he seeks to comfort a woman whose
      <q class="lyrics">son had been shot down in the street and died, just because of the system.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     The positive emotions that Bob and Jesus <b>warmth</b> in these images
    </p>
    <p>
     The emotions that <b>Red</b> represents in these images are not always positive, but in this case
      it represents the love that Bob and Jesus have and express for other people.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Differences</h5>
    <p>
     The images also show there are some differences between Bob and Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most obviously the image of Bob's personality has more <b>Blue</b>, indicating he has more i<b>N</b>tuition.
     His image looks more open and accepting because he is more open-minded &mdash; more <b>P</b>erceptive &mdash; than Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, the <q><b>P</b></q> in <b>ENFP</b> stands for <b>P</b>erceiving &mdash; the opposite of
      <q><b>J</b>udging.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, the image of Jesus' personality has more <b>Red</b>, indicating he has more <b>F</b>eeling.
     His image looks warmer and heavier because he is more determined &mdash; more <b>J</b>udgmental &mdash; than Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, the <q><b>J</b></q> in <b>INFJ</b> stands for <q><b>J</b>udging</q> &mdash; the opposite of <b>P</b>erceiving.

    <h4 class="center">Takeaway - Bottom Line - Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
     The reason I like having Bob Marley as my own Personal Jesus is his openness and positivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     His music helps me see the big picture, which comforts me in difficult times.
     For example: Real Situation, Three Little Birds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bob helps me resist the temptation to dislike all religious people, based on the
