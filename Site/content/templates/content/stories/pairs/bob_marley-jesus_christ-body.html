     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of Bob Marley, a central figure in Reggae music, and
      Jesus Christ, <i>the</i> central figure in the Christian religion.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">xNFx: Blue and Red</h4>
    <p>
     Both images contain a lot of Blue and Red, because both Bob and Jesus tend to be idealistic and compassionate.
    </p>
    <p>
     In terms of the four-letter types made popular by the MBTI&reg;, both are <b>xNFx</b> &mdash;
      indicating both of them exhibit Carl Jung's i<b>N</b>tuition and <b>F</b>eeling traits.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Blue &mdash; i<b>N</b>tuition</h5>
    <p>
     The <b>Blue</b> in these images represents the trait Jung and the MBTI call i<b>N</b>tuition.
     A person who is high in i<b>N</b>tuition tends to see things and events more in terms of ideas than facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Bob and Jesus were different in many ways, the idea of God plays a major role in both of their lives.
     For example, rather than singing about God, Bob uses the term <q class="expression">Jah</q> in songs such
      <q class="song-title">Forever Loving Jah</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      and <q class="song-title">Rastaman Vibration</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
     As far as I'm concerned, anyone who asserts there is a significant difference between God and Jah is just being
      disagreeable &mdash; and unnecessarily defensive and divisive.
    </p>
    <p>
     This <i>idea</i> that a higher power exists is one reason they are more idealistic than realistic.
     Now, this does not mean that everyone who is iNtuitive believes in Jah or God or Allah, only that more pragmatic
      people tend to doubt the existance of something they cannot see, hear, touch, smell, or taste.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Red &mdash; <b>F</b>eeling</h5>
    <p>
     The <b>Red</b> in these images represents the trait Jung and the MBTI call <b>F</b>eeling.
     A person who is high in <b>F</b>eeling tends to be more emotional than logical, and tends to prefer working with
      other people to working with inanimate things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Bob and Jesus were compassionate and cared a lot about other people.
     While Jesus demonstrated his compassion by healing the sick, Bob makes his opinion clear in songs like
      <q class="song-title">Jammin',</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he claims <q class="lyrics">life is worth much more than gold.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Bob lacked Jesus' ability to perform miracles, he sought to comfort people with songs such as
      <q class="song-title">Three Little Birds,</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he sings that <q class="lyrics">every little thing gonna be alright</q> and
      <q class="song-title">Johnny Was,</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      in which he seeks to comfort a woman whose
      <q class="lyrics">son had been shot down in the street and died, just because of the system.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     The emotions that <b>Red</b> represents in these images are not always positive, but in this case
      it represents the love that Bob and Jesus have and express for other people.
