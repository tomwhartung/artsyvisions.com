     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>

         target='_blank' title='Image of the personality of Jamie Lannister on SeeOurMinds.com'>
       Jamie</a>,
      who are twins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tywin, Cersei, and Jamie Lannister are primary protagonists &mdash;
      and the nemeses of
      <a href='https://www.seeourminds.com/gallery/1410-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-house_stark/'
         target='_blank' title='Gallery containing images of the personalities of House Stark on SeeOurMinds.com'>

    <h4 class="center">A Rational, Realistic Family</h4>
    <p>
     The Green that dominates all three of these images represents the
      Lannisters' preference for being rational and decisive.
     They do not hesitate to make demands of others, and
      they expect to be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Yellow in these spiritual portraits represents the Lannisters'
      realism &mdash; their preference for seeing the world in terms of
      facts rather than ideas.
     This is both natural and understandable because one very important
      fact is the Lannisters have a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Ambitious Family</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Tywin: the hard ass.
     Not at all open, actually a control freak, and always right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cersei: more human than Tywin.
     Passionate about her children, and little else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jamie: more open and hence more human than his father and sister, and
      his father berates him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

     <b><em>What is the big picture revealed by the image or images?</em></b>
    </p>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show how ....
    </p>

    <h4 class="center">A Missed Opportunity</h4>
    <p>
     The Lannisters really blow it when they exclude Tyrion from their team.
     This is mostly Tywin's and Cersei's doing, Jamie is alone in caring
      about his brother.

       For people who know the story of this family, seeing these images is so sad.

       Tyrion has the qualities the others lack &mdash; insight and compassion
        &mdash; in abundance.

    <p>
     It's OK to add a little first-person comment here &mdash; after
      a paragraph containing a few centered mdash-es &mdash; to help
      sum things up, and transition to the review, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe end with a sales pitch?
     Review Daniel Pink's book first!
     Keep thinking about the benefits of spiritual portraits with respect
      to relationships, teams, and self-knowledge.
     Consider adding a sales pitch to the end of all articles, at some point....
