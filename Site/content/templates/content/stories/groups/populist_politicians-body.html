    <h4 class="center">The Superficialities</h4>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry was one of America's Founding Fathers, the
      First and Sixth Governor of Virginia, and a close friend of
      <a href="https://SeeOurMinds.com/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/"
         title="Image of George Washington at SeeOurMinds.com" target="_blank">
       George Washington</a>.
     Charles Foster Kane is the fictional protagonist of Orson Welles’
      film
      <a href="{{ afl_content.citizen_kane }}" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
        Citizen Kane</a>, 1941.
     Clay Davis is a fictional politician in David Simon’s television series
      <a href="{{ afl_content.wire }}" class="series-title" target="_blank">
       The Wire</a>, 2002-2008.
     And Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     All four are American and involved in politics to some degree.
     Clay Davis is African-American, and
      Patrick Henry and Donald Trump are red-heads &mdash; but
      Henry frequently wore a brown wig.
     Charles Foster Kane was created and played by Orson Welles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Henry and Trump are real people, Kane and Clay exist
      only in works of fiction &mdash; but their characters are based on real
      people.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
     Henry lived in the eighteenth century, Kane was the product of the
      twentieth century, and Clay and Trump are contemporary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite these superficial differences, the spiritual portraits of
      all four look fairly similar.
     Anyone familiar with one or more of them
      has a feel for what the others are like.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Passionate Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show Henry, Kane,  Davis, and Trump are
      outgoing, passionate, decisive, and realistic.
     They understand people and do not hesitate to tell them
      what they believe the people want to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red, representing their passion, is the most prominent of
      these qualities.
     The Yellow, representing their realism, is less prominent but
      adds to the portraits' warmth.
     The Green in Henry's and Trump's portraits show these
      real people are a bit more decisive and logical than the
      fictional Kane and Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
     These outgoing people have so much passion, they enjoy
      sharing it with &mdash; or inflicting it on, as some
      would say &mdash; their constituents.
     Their willingness to be blunt contributes to their charisma.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Passionate Constituents</h4>
    <p>
     As outgoing and decisive people, Henry, Kane, Clay, and Trump
      are far from being shy, retiring, and contemplative.
     They relish being the center of attention,
      their speeches are full of passion, and their
      temperaments can be volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Making emotional appeals, their proposals for reform
      are met with mixed sentiments.
     It is only natural for them to elicit emotional reactions
      from their supporters and detractors alike.
    </p>
    <p>
     The passion people feel for these politicians is aptly
      summed up in the proclamation of the newsreel announcer
      who introduces Charles Foster Kane to viewers early on in
      <span class="movie-title">Citizen Kane:</span>
      <q class="dialog">Spoke for millions of Americans.
       Was hated by as many more.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic Politicians</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in these portraits indicate Henry, Kane, Davis, and Trump
      have a tendency to be realistic and pragmatic.
    </p>
    <h6 class="center">Realistic About Future Leaders</h6>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry's opposition to ratifying the Constitution and
      insistence on a Bill of Rights is a good example of his pragmatism.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="toms-blockquote">
     <q>If your American chief be a man of ambition and abilities,</q>
     Henry warned, <q>how easy is it for him to render himself absolute!
     The army is in his hands ....

     What will then become of you and your rights?
     Will not absolute despotism

    </blockquote>
    <p>
     The Virginia convention eventually
      voted to ratify the new Constitution,
      despite Henry's protestations.
     However, his concerns paved the way for the passage of the
      <span class="document-title">Bill of Rights</span>
      the following year, in 1789.
    </p>
    <h6 class="center">Realistic About Principles</h6>
    <p>
     Charles Foster Kane's pragmatism becomes evident when he writes a
      <span class="document-title">Declaration of Principles.</span>
     The name may be patterned after
      <a href="https://ArtsyVisions.com/visions/story/0040-person-thomas_jefferson"

       Thomas Jefferson's</a>
      <span class="document-title">Declaration of Independence,</span>
      but it is not nearly as high-minded as it sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     It turns out there are only two statements in Kane’s
      <q class="document-title">Declaration,</q> and both start with
      the personal pronoun <q class="dialog">I.</q>
     As Kane’s <q class="dialog">oldest friend</q>
      Jedidiah Leland points out, Kane
      <q class="dialog">never believed in anything except Charles Kane.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Wealthy Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     Another common thread running through the lives of Patrick Henry,
      Charles Foster Kane, Clay Davis, and Donald Trump is wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry grew up in
      <q class="from-document">one of Hanover County's finest
       houses.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     Charles Foster Kane and Donald Trump inherited massive amounts of money.
     And Clay Davis' character first appears in
      <span class="series-title">The Wire</span>
      when his driver picks up a bagful of drug money from the
      <a href="https://SeeOurMinds.com/gallery/1530-fictional-tv-the_wire-barksdales/"
         title="Gallery of images of Avon Barksdale's crew at SeeOurMinds.com" target="_blank">
       Barksdale organanization</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether their wealth is ultimately due to their charismatic
      appeal, or they feel free to fully express themselves
      because they are wealthy, is hard to say.
     Certainly inheriting wealth can help immunize someone to the ill effects
       of their mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is, unlike most people, people born into wealth can
      do no wrong &mdash; and are free do do what ever
      they <em>feel</em> like doing.
    </p>

    <h4 class="center">Atypical Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     This section features spiritual portraits of several American
      presidents.
     Far from being a complete list, these are just some of the more
      well-known holders of America's top office.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
     <div class="col l6">
      <p>
       There is a lot of information in these images!
       It took months to create &mdash; to research and analyze the people, and
        to produce, post and explain these portraits &mdash; so
        it's only natural for it to take some time to understand them.
      </p>
      <h6 class="center">Other Presidents</h6>
      <p>
       These images show the personalities of Patrick Henry,
        Charles Foster Kane, Clay Davis, and Donald Trump
        are different from the other, more typical leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of all of these images, only Patrick Henry's and Donald Trump's
        show they are ruled by their emotions.
       The presence of more Red than Green
        in the spiritual portraits of Henry and Trump
        represents their tendency to favor emotion over logic.
      </p>
      <h6 class="center">Lawyers Are Logical</h6>
      <p>
       Many politicians start out as lawyers.
       Governments make and enforce laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding the law requires understanding logic.
       It's
        <em>if</em> someone commits the crime,
        <em>then</em> they are guilty,
        <b>not</b> so-and-so is guilty because I
        <em>feel like</em>&nbsp; they are guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic is universal, so people are more likely
        to understand and agree with a logical decision than an emotional one.
      </p>
      <h6 class="center">Emotions Are Powerful</h6>
      <p>
       Once a lawyer understands the logic behind the law, a versatile
        person could add some emotional appeal to an argument when, for
        example, adressing a jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lawyer's emotional appeal needs to be secondary and in addition to
        understanding the logic of the law.
       If he prefers being emotional to being logical, he needs to know
        how to let the logic take precedence in his professional work.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is precisely what Patrick Henry did when he was starting out
        as a lawyer.
      </p>

     Then, as Henry got older and more experienced, he went from
      powerfully advocating for his clients to
      powerfully advocating for individual liberty &mdash;
      ultimately famously declaring
      <q class="dialog">Give me liberty, or give me death,</q>
      in a thunderous speech in Richmond, Virginia.

    <p>
     Although logical people have an advantage over more
      emotional people when it comes to running for office,
      Patrick Henry, Clay Davis, and Donald Trump prove
      that emotional people can get elected anyway.

    <h4 class="center">My Favorite Presidents</h4>
    <p>
     My favorite presidents are the ones who are more idealistic &mdash;
      the ones with more Blue in their spiritual portraits.
     Yes, I have more Blue in my portrait, and my preference
      for ideas over facts is a big reason I enjoy working
      on this project.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that's not the whole story: I like Washington and FDR, and
      their personalities are very different from mine.
     But then again, if I had to choose between Theodore Roosevelt
      and Woodrow Wilson, I'd pick WW.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's clear emotional candidates either appeal to
      other emotional people, or they can bring other's
      emotions to the surface
      &mdash; or both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Does everyone prefer the candidates who have personalities
      more similar to their own?

     The goal of this article is to objectively examine what these people
      have in common &mdash; why their spiritual portraits look
      so much alike &mdash; without making anyone angry.
     This might be difficult, or even impossible, but I am going to give it a try.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably not, but I am determined to show anyone who's interested
      where these emotions come from, and what they look like.
     If you think this article is the source of your anger, well I
      find that super-funny!
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to the Red and Green, it is worth looking at the
      Introverts and Extraverts.
     It seems Extraversion would be an important trait in a leader.
     Still, several Introverts have held the presidency, for example,
      Washington, Jefferson, Wilson, and Kennedy.
     Of course, Washington and Jefferson did not have to campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their personalities are quite different from those of the more quiet,
      idealistic presidents such as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and
      John F. Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is easy to see how Henry and Washington would be good friends,
      their images both have the same sort of feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore it's easy to see how lawyers and politicians would tend to be logical

    <p>
     Kane’s success in the newspaper business &mdash; in addition to his
      ego &mdash; leads him to run for Governor of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
     Similarly, Donald Trump also found fame in the media, first with his
      reality TV show The Apprentice, and later with his persistent
      exhortations that President Obama’s birth certificate is invalid.
     His opinionated, decisive personality and presence in the
      media &mdash; in addition to his ego &mdash; led him to run for
      President of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     Donald Trump’s election shows he does indeed, like Charles Foster Kane,
      speak <q class="dialog">for millions of Americans.</q>
     And the aftermath of his victory makes it equally plain he
      is “hated by as many more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Charles Foster Kane and Donald Trump benefited from large
      inheritances, enabling them to run their own companies at an early age.
    </p>
    <p>
     The freedom granted by this wealth means Kane and Trump could hire
      people at will, tell them to do whatever they felt like telling them
      to do, and fire them for any offense, big or small, real or imagined.
     This ability to be tyrannical, along with their opinionated and outspoken
      manner, fuels the love-hate relationship they have with the public.
    </p>
    <p>
     Love and hate are two of the strongest human emotions.
     The spiritual portraits of Charles Foster Kane and Donald Trump both
      feature a long Vertical Red line on the left side of their images,
      indicating they are comfortable expressing their emotions.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Differences in Context, Not Substance</h4>
    <p>
     The main difference between Charles Foster Kane and Donald
      Trump &mdash; other than the obvious fact that Kane is a fictional
      character while Trump is real &mdash; is not in their personalities,
      but in the times in which they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ultimately, this comparison shows a decline in the importance of
      morality to Americans during the time between Kane’s rise,
      from the 1900s to 1940s, and Trump’s rise, from the 1970s to the 2010s.
     Those intervening decades have seen the rise of American exceptionalism
      after World War II, the invention of the birth control pill and the
      resultant loosening of sexual morality, and the rise of the internet and
      social networking &mdash; to mention only a very few but major advances.
    </p>
    <p>
     As abstract images of their personalities, these spiritual portraits of
      course do not make any attempt to depict these differences,
      because they are differences in context rather than of substance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trying to identify Trump’s ideals and principles leads to a similar
      conclusion: he doesn’t have any.
     Does he even have a friend &mdash; like Kane’s Jedidiah &mdash; brave
      enough to state he “never believed in anything except” Donald Trump?
     Given the churn in his administration, it seems unlikely.
     Trump is so tyrannical and narcissistic that the most cynical of his
      opponents &mdash; and there are many &mdash; believe he thinks he’s God.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">When Style Reveals Substance</h4>
    <p>
     Decades after its production, movie critics continue to admire &mdash;
      and film students continue to learn to appreciate &mdash; Citizen Kane
      more for its revolutionary style than for its substance.
     One of the most important ways Citizen Kane differs from the
      films before that time is its narrative structure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The film actually begins with the death of the protagonist and
      reveals Charles Foster Kane’s life through a series of flashbacks.
     The first word uttered in the film &mdash;
      <q class="dialog">Rosebud</q> &mdash; comes just as Kane dies.
     This ability to see Kane’s entire life as a reporter tries to
      learn the significance of the word gives viewers an insight into
      Kane that is currently unattainable with Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the course of the film, viewers learn Kane has died a lonely old man.
     Having reached a pinnacle of success unimaginable to most, in the end
      he has driven everyone else away with his self-centered, irrational,
      tyrannical ways.
     As Kane’s <q class="dialog">oldest friend,</q> Jedidiah Leland
      observes, <q class="dialog">That must have been pretty unpleasant.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     It is the flashbacks of Jedidiah Leland &mdash; who confesses he may
      have been more of a <q class="dialog">stooge</q> than a friend &mdash;
      that give viewers the deepest insight into Kane’s character.
     In one of the film’s most enlightening scenes Jedidiah claims Charles
      Foster Kane <q class="dialog">did everything,</q> from getting
      married to going into politics, <q class="dialog">for love.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     While most politicians prefer to appeal to logic that everyone can
      understand &mdash; if you commit murder, then you will go to
      jail &mdash; these two prefer to appeal to people’s emotions.
     Trump made the power of this sort of appeal plain when he infamously
      claimed he could “shoot somebody” and not “lose any voters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     During his campaign, Citizen Kane declared he would clean up the
      current corrupt administration run by Jim W. Gettys.
     Similarly, during his campaign, Donald Trump declared he would clean
      up the current, corrupt administration by “draining the swamp.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The corrupt Gettys ultimately defeats the populist Kane, however,
      by exposing his extramarital affair with Susan Alexander.
     It is only natural that, upon losing the election, the headline on the
      front page of Kane’s Inquirer decried “Fraud at Polls!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Donald Trump showed he was of a similar mind when during one of the
      debates he was asked whether he would accept the results if
      he lost the election.
     He declared the only way he could lose if if there was fraud at the polls.
     And even though the he won the electoral vote and hence the election,
      Trump still insisted he did not win the popular vote because of
      election fraud.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Spoiler Alert!</h4>
    <p>
     If you haven’t seen Citizen Kane, and now want to see it,
      consider stopping here.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if you’re a fan of Donald Trump, also consider stopping here,
      because the following is rather sad &mdash; and I do not want to
      upset people, only enlighten them.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Can’t Buy Me Love</h4>
    <p>
     Most viewers probably get the impression
      <q class="dialog">Rosebud</q> is an object, but I assert it is
      an emotion &mdash; represented by the Red line in Kane’s
      image &mdash; his need for love.
     As Jedidiah observes after Kane is gone:
      <q class="dialog">All he really wanted out of life was love.
      That's Charlie's story, how he lost it.
      You see, he just didn't have any to give.
      He loved Charlie Kane, of course.  [Chuckles.]  Very dearly.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Is this how things will end with Donald Trump?  Will he wind up dying
      a lonely old man, yearning for a love he experienced only as a child,
      before he was corrupted by wealth he did not earn?
     Given his volatile temperament, it’s easy to imagine him experiencing
      a similarly miserable fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     What will be Donald Trump’s Rosebud?  Only time will tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Will there be a “film at 11?”  Of course there will be &mdash; some day!
     And when it comes to people who are more emotional than logical,
      that is one of the few things we can predict with certainty.
