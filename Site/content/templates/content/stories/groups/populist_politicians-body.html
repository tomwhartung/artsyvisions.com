    <h4 class="center">The Superficialities</h4>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry was one of America's Founding Fathers, the
      First and Sixth Governor of Virginia, and a close friend of
      <a href="https://SeeOurMinds.com/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/"
         title="Image of George Washington at SeeOurMinds.com" target="_blank">
       George Washington</a>.
     Charles Foster Kane is the fictional protagonist of the film
      <a href="{{ afl_content.citizen_kane }}" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
        Citizen Kane</a>, 1941.
     Clay Davis is a fictional politician in David Simon’s television series
      <a href="{{ afl_content.wire }}" class="series-title" target="_blank">
       The Wire</a>, 2002-2008.
     And Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     All four are American and involved in politics to some degree.
     Clay Davis is African-American, and
      Patrick Henry and Donald Trump are red-heads &mdash; but
      Henry frequently wore a brown wig.
     Charles Foster Kane was created and played by Orson Welles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Henry and Trump are real people, Kane and Clay exist
      only in works of fiction &mdash; but their characters are based on real
      people.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
     Henry lived in the eighteenth century, Kane was the product of the
      twentieth century, and Clay and Trump are contemporary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite these superficial differences, the spiritual portraits of
      all four have a similar look and feel.
     Anyone familiar with one or more of them already
      has a sense of what the others are like.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Passionate Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show Henry, Kane,  Davis, and Trump are
      outgoing, passionate, decisive, and realistic.
     They understand people and do not hesitate to tell them
      what they feel &mdash; and what they believe othes want to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red in these images represents their passion, which
      is the most prominent of these qualities.
     The Yellow, representing their realism, is less prominent but
      adds to the portraits' warmth.
     The Green in Henry's and Trump's portraits show these
      real people are a bit more decisive and logical than the
      fictional Kane and Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
     These outgoing people have so much passion, they enjoy
      sharing it with &mdash; or inflicting it on, as some
      would say &mdash; their constituents.
     Their willingness to be blunt when so many others are
      relatively reserved contributes to their charisma.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Passionate Constituents</h4>
    <p>
     As outgoing and decisive people, Henry, Kane, Clay, and Trump
      are far from being shy, retiring, and contemplative.
     They relish being the center of attention,
      their speeches are full of passion, and their
      temperaments can be volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because they frequently appeal to emotion rather than logic,
      their proposals for reform are met with mixed sentiments.
     This also makes it natural for them to elicit emotional reactions
      from their supporters and detractors alike.
    </p>
    <p>
     The passion people feel for these politicians is aptly
      summed up in the proclamation of the newsreel announcer
      who introduces Charles Foster Kane to viewers early on in
      <span class="movie-title">Citizen Kane:</span>
      <q class="dialog">Spoke for millions of Americans.

    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic Politicians</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in these portraits indicate Henry, Kane, Davis, and Trump
      have a tendency to be realistic and pragmatic.
    </p>
    <h6 class="center">Realistic About Future Leaders</h6>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry's opposition to ratifying the Constitution and
      insistence on a Bill of Rights is a good example of his pragmatism.

     The Virginia convention eventually
      voted to ratify the new Constitution,

     The name of Kane's document may be patterned after

      but it is not nearly as high-minded as it sounds.

    <h4 class="center">Wealthy Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     Another common thread running through the lives of Patrick Henry,
      Charles Foster Kane, Clay Davis, and Donald Trump is wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patrick Henry grew up in
      <q class="from-document">one of Hanover County's finest
       houses.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     Charles Foster Kane and Donald Trump inherited massive amounts of money.
     And Clay Davis' character first appears in
      <span class="series-title">The Wire</span>
      when his driver picks up a bagful of drug money from the
      <a href="https://SeeOurMinds.com/gallery/1530-fictional-tv-the_wire-barksdales/"

       Barksdale organanization</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether their wealth is ultimately due to their charismatic
      appeal, or they feel free to fully express themselves
      because they are wealthy, is hard to say.
     Certainly inheriting wealth can help immunize someone to the ill effects
       of their mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     That is, unlike most people, those who are born into wealth are
      insulated from a reality that can be cold and harsh &mdash; and
      are free do do what ever they <em>feel</em> like doing.

      <h6 class="center">Lawyers Are Logical</h6>
      <p>
       Many politicians start out as lawyers.
       This makes perfect sense because governments make and enforce laws.
       It's natural for someone to take time to understand and debate the
        intent and fairness of laws before writing new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding the law requires understanding logic.
       It's
        <q class="italic"><u>if</u> someone commits a crime,
         <u>then</u> they are guilty,</q>
        <b>not</b>
        <q class="italic">so-and-so is guilty because I
        <u>feel like</u>&nbsp; they are guilty.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic is universal, so people are more likely
        to understand and agree with a logical decision than an emotional one.

      <p>
       Once a lawyer understands the logic behind the law, a versatile
        person could add some emotional appeal to an argument when, for
        example, adressing a jury.
       A lawyer's emotional appeal needs to be secondary and in addition to
        understanding the logic of the law.

       If a barrister prefers being emotional to being logical, they need to know

       This is precisely what Patrick Henry did when he was starting out
        as a lawyer.

       Then, as Henry got older and more experienced, he went from

    <h6 class="center">Atypical Officeholders?</h6>
    <p>
     Although logical people have an advantage over more
      emotional people when it comes to running for office,
      Patrick Henry, Clay Davis, and Donald Trump prove
      that emotional people can get elected anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     One could assert that people with outgoing
      personalities have a better shot at getting elected,
      because the press is constantly bombarding candidates
      and politicians with questions.
     After all, <q class="mantra">if you snooze, you lose.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     The images above of popular politicians' personalities
      show plenty of these people &mdash;
      notably Jefferson, Wilson, and Kennedy &mdash; are more
      reticent than most.
     Sure, Kennedy whupped Nixon in the nation's first televised
      presidential debate, but that is probably more the result of
      superficial appearances &mdash; the youthful Kennedy was much
      better looking than the stodgy Nixon &mdash; than the substance
      of the candidates' personalities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could it be that the twenty-four hour news cycle makes it
      easier now for people who are more emotional and
      more difficult for people who are more withdrawn?
     That theory might make intuitive sense, but
      proving it is problematic.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">My Favorite Presidents</h4>
    <p>
     My favorite presidents are the ones who are more idealistic &mdash;
      the ones with more Blue in their spiritual portraits.
     In the group above that includes:
      Adams, Jefferson, Wilson, Kennedy, Reagan, and Clinton.
     There's no doubt in my mind this is because I am also
      idealistic &mdash; as you can see from the Blue in
      <a href="https://www.SeeOurMinds.com/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/"

         target="_blank">
       my own spiritual portraits</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this is not the whole story: I like Washington and FDR, and
      their personalities are almost the opposite of mine.
     But then again, if I had to choose between Theodore Roosevelt
      and Woodrow Wilson, I'd pick the more reticent, academic WW
      over the reckless, in-your-face TR any day.
    </p>
    <h6 class="center">Enough History, What About Today?</h6>
    <p>
     Today it's clear emotional candidates either appeal to
      other emotional people, or they can bring other's
      emotions to the surface &mdash; or both.
     Does everyone prefer the candidates who have personalities
      more similar to their own?
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe personality is just one of many factors &mdash;
      but that it is far more important than the superficial
      factors many people insist on focusing on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today it's clear partisan thinking is creating deep wounds in
      our country's fabric.
     I would like nothing more than to shift the discussion away from
      superficial partisanship to looking &mdash; quite literally &mdash;
      past the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have spent years working on making the invisible visible,
     I would like nothing more than for politicians and candidates to
      let me draw their personalities, so all voters know who's running
      the show and what we're getting into if we elect a replacement.

    <h4 class="center">Challenging All Politicians and Candidates</h4>
    <p>
     Citizens shouldn't have to guess what a candidate's
      personality is really like.
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe a candidate's personal preferences, as identified by
      answering a questionnaire designed to assess Jungian personality
      types, are more important than what political party they belong to.
    </p>
    <p class="center bold">
     I challenge all politicians to answer one of the Jungian
      questionnaires and send me the results, so I can draw
      your image.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will create your spiritual portrait and share it with you and
      post it online &mdash; with your statement,
      if possible.
