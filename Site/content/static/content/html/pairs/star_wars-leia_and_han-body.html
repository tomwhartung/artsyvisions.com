    <p>The images above are Grojas¹, images representing the personalities of Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo, from the original Star Wars trilogy.  The two characters are opposites in many ways, and this partly explains both the attraction they feel for one another and the reason they bicker so much.</p>
    <p>From the moment they meet in the original Star Wars movie, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, Leia and Han start bickering.  It’s likely this is when they start to feel attracted to one another, and the bickering is an effort to cover up this attraction.</p>
    <p>As a Princess, Leia is by nature responsible, and as a smuggler, Han is inclined to be irresponsible.  As a leader of the resistance, Leia has one eye on the present and another on the future.  As a man who owes a lot of money to the murderous gangster Jabba the Hutt, Han is focused on the present.</p>
    <p>The spiritual portraits above reflect these differences in attitudes.  Significantly, all of Leia’s preferences are very slight, making her image very colorful.  In contrast, the Yellow in Han’s image shows his preference for living in the moment is very strong.</p>
    <p>The Green in Leia’s image depicts her preference for being rational.  This is an important quality in a leader, because it is easier for other people to agree with someone who makes objective, logical decisions than someone who makes personal, emotional decisions.  Exercising this preference can frequently make a person put their emotions to the side, especially during times of crisis, when it is important to keep calm so the mind can function.  Given that Leia and Han meet when they are being fired upon by Imperial Stormtroopers, this explains how the bickering starts.</p>
    <p>When they meet, Leia immediately starts bossing Han around.  Han is his own boss, however, and instantly rebels.  Because he is rebelling against a leader of the rebellion – not to mention helping to rescue her from certain death – Leia has little choice but to put up with Han’s insolence and taunts of “Your worshipfulness.”</p>
    <p>This is happening at a time when the Galactic Empire has built a Death Star capable of destroying entire planets.  As a leader, Leia’s main job is to get her people through it safely.  She knows she must put aside distractions and focus on defeating, or at least evading, the Imperial forces that want to destroy her and the rebellion.  From the time they meet, the rebellious Han is her single biggest distraction, and she does her best to ignore him and her feelings.</p>
    <p>The Yellow in Han’s image shows he is a bit more perceptive than Leia, and the Red depicts his slight preference for emotions over logic.  He senses her underlying feelings, but he can plainly see what’s going on, so he bides his time rather than press things.</p>
    <p>Just as Leia has her emotions and feelings of attraction lurking beneath her cool but bossy exterior, Han has sincerity, courage, and concern for others lurking beneath his insolence and independent attitude.  As they face and manage to survive a series of challenges, their defensiveness gradually crumbles and their bond strengthens.  Finally, at a critical moment Leia lets her guard down.  She finally lets her emotions show and tells Han “I love you,” to which Han responds “I know,” showing he is not the least bit surprised.</p>
    <p>Whether opposite personalities truly attract, and whether a relationship between opposites – intense though it may be – can stand the test of time, is a matter of debate.  Moreover, as interesting as it is, the dynamic between Han and Leia is only one of many reasons the Star Wars movies continue to entertain viewers and spawn successful prequels and sequels decades after the first film.</p>
    <p>Understanding the psychological dynamics between fictional characters can give people insight into real-world relationships, but they are far from the whole story.  There are plenty of other, much more obvious factors at play in relationships, such as overall appearance, age, culture, preferences in hobbies and sexual activities, and even manipulative parents who ostensibly only want the “best” for their children.  Any and all of these factors can complicate matters, and even the best relationship can fall prey to the hazards of ennui.</p>
    <p>However, Grojas such as these can make the intangible, not-so-obvious differences in psychological preferences that all personalities, whether fictional or real, more palpable.   This makes them easier to understand, think about, and discuss.</p>
    <p>Because communication is key to happy productive relationships, anything that can facilitate a dialog about the way people perceive the world and make decisions about it – whether they are obvious or strictly subconscious – is bound to help.  And helping as well as entertaining and enlightening others is ultimately the goal of these images and this article!</p>
