     The abstract images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
      depicting the personalities of the
      fictional characters Fox Mulder and Dana Scully,
      Special Agents in the FBI on the show
       <a href="https://amzn.to/2QCqV7B" class="series-title" target="_blank">
        The X-Files</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the show Mulder and Scully are partners, and it's immediately
      clear they have different personalities.
     It should come as no surprise to fans of the show to see how
      different their spiritual portraits look from each
      other &mdash; and how they show just how different they are.

      Scully’s portrait</a>.
     These colors show his personality is the
      opposite of hers.
     However, both images are colorful enough to suggest they may be
      flexible enough to get along &mdash; if, for example, they
      share similar goals.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Decisions</h5>
    <p>
     The long horizontal Red line near the bottom of Special Agent Mulder’s
      portrait depicts his preference for making emotional decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulder's preference is most obvious in his decision to dedicate his life
      to learning what happened to his beloved half-sister,
      whom he believes was abducted by aliens.
     For obvious reasons, he keeps this goal mostly to himself, leading his
      colleagues to be suspicious of his motives and mock him with the
      nickname “Spooky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait is full of Green, the opposite of
      Red, depicting her preference for logical decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     A preference for being cool and rational is important for people
      who are in law enforcement, because incarcerating someone based on an
      emotion &mdash; a feeling or superstition of some sort &mdash;
      is obviously wrong.
     In an organization like the FBI Scully can, unlike Mulder,
      easily afford to be vocal in expressing her preference.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Perspectives</h5>
    <p>
     Fox and Dana also see the world differently.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue in Mulder’s image represents his openness to new ideas.
     He <q class="mantra">wants to believe</q> not just in aliens,
      but in all sorts of paranormal activities.
     It is Mulder’s openness to these ideas that makes the X-Files
      so different from the standard police procedurals such as Dragnet,
      Hill Street Blues, the various Law and Order and CSI series, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait has more Yellow &mdash; the opposite of
      Blue &mdash; depicting her preference for facts.
     Again, as far as being a law enforcement officer is concerned,
      Scully is the <q class="slang">normal</q> one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most people expect officers to have a preference for facts over
      ideas. because facts are there for everyone to see.
     Ideas, on the other hand, are not necessarily shared, and
      can sometimes exist only in the mind of the beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
     As is the case with her preference for logic, Dana is the one who
      can afford to express her pragmatic perceptions,
      while Mulder is best off keeping his ideas &mdash; which are
      all too often very unconventional &mdash; to himself.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Directions</h5>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Same Team</h5>
    <p>
     Once Mulder and Scully survive several hair-raising, life-threatening
      experiences, they establish trust in each other and form a team
      unlike any other.
     It is important to note that these primitive images do not depict
      traits such as their ethics and morality &mdash; concern for
      others and a sense of fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like Scully’s preferences for facts and logic, ethics and morality
      are traits we hope to find in people worthy of the public trust.
     It is these shared goals that enable the seemingly mismatched Scully
      and Mulder to combine their skills and successfully face any
      challenge, whether it is real, unreal, or something in between.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is this pairing of opposite personalities &mdash; two people who
      manage to find common ground and support each other despite their
      differences &mdash; that gives the X-Files its enduring quality.
     It is so unique that, if another show came along with similar
      characters, many people would no doubt see it as a rip-off.
