     The abstract images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
      depicting the personalities of the
      fictional characters Fox Mulder and Dana Scully,
      Special Agents in the FBI on the show
       <a href="https://amzn.to/2QCqV7B" class="series-title" target="_blank">
        The X-Files</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the show Mulder and Scully are partners, and it's immediately
      clear they have different personalities.
     Their spiritual portraits reflect their difference tendencies,
      and show the two Special Agents are in fact opposites.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Opposites at Work</h4>
    <p>
     The warm Red and deep Blue in
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com/image/3700-fictional-tv-x_files/3700/'
         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Fox Mulder on SeeOurMinds.com'
         target='_blank'>
      Mulder’s image</a>
     contrasts strongly with the cool Green and flat Yellow in
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com/image/3700-fictional-tv-x_files/3704/'
         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Dana Scully on SeeOurMinds.com'
         target='_blank'>
      Scully’s portrait</a>.
     These colors, along with the compositions of the images,
     show Mulder's personality is the opposite of Scully's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although both images show strong preferences, they
      are both also colorful enough to suggest the agents'
      preferences are moderate and they can get along despite
      these differences.
     This would be the case if, for example, they share similar goals.
     Fortunately for the F.B.I., this turns out to be the case.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Decisions</h5>
    <p>
     The long horizontal Red line near the bottom of Special Agent Mulder’s
      portrait depicts his preference for making emotional decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mulder's preference is most obvious in his decision to dedicate his life
      to learning what happened to his beloved half-sister,
      whom he believes was abducted by aliens.
     For obvious reasons, he keeps this goal mostly to himself, leading his
      colleagues to be suspicious of his motives and mock him with the
      nickname “Spooky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait is full of Green, the opposite of
      Red, depicting her preference for logical decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     A preference for being cool and rational is important for people
      who are in law enforcement, because incarcerating someone based on an
      emotion &mdash; a feeling or superstition of some sort &mdash;
      is obviously wrong.
     In an organization like the FBI Scully can, unlike Mulder,
      easily afford to be vocal in expressing her preference.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Perspectives</h5>
    <p>
     Fox and Dana also see the world differently.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue in Mulder’s image represents his openness to new ideas.
     He <q class="mantra">wants to believe</q> not just in aliens,
      but in all sorts of paranormal activities.
     It is Mulder’s openness to these ideas that makes the X-Files
      so different from the standard police procedurals such as Dragnet,
      Hill Street Blues, the various Law and Order and CSI series, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait has more Yellow &mdash; the opposite of
      Blue &mdash; depicting her preference for facts.
     Again, as far as being a law enforcement officer is concerned,
      Scully is the <q class="slang">normal</q> one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most people expect officers to have a preference for facts over
      ideas. because facts are there for everyone to see.
     Ideas, on the other hand, are not necessarily shared, and
      can sometimes exist only in the mind of the beholder.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Different Directions</h5>
    <p>
     As is the case with her preference for logic, Dana Scully is the one who
      can afford to express her preference for pragmatic perceptions,
      while Fox Mulder is best off keeping his ideas &mdash; which are
      all too often very unconventional &mdash; to himself.
     The compositions of the spiritual portraits above reflect this.
    </p>
    <p>
     The long, horizontal Red line near the bottom of Mulder's image
      represents his tendency to be more reticent.
     In contrast, Scully's portrait has a long vertical line near the left
      side<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      of her image, reflecting how she is more comfortable speaking out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The colors and the compositions of these images show that Scully and
      Mulder are complete opposites &mdash; that is, opposites in all
      four of the aspects comprising these Jungian profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
     This does not by any means imply they hate each other, though!
     Quite the contrary,
      <b>Scully and Mulder's ability to confirm their preferences &mdash;
       to run a <q class="slang"><u>sanity check</u></q> on their perceptions
       and decisions &mdash; by consulting with a trusted partner who has
       opposing preferences, is what makes the X-Files team greater
       than the sum of its parts.</b>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Same Team</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Fox Mulder and Dana Scully survive a few life-threatening
      experiences together, they establish a mutual trust and
      bond to form a unique team.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ethics and morality &mdash; much like Scully’s preferences for
      facts and logic &mdash; are also traits citizens hope to find in
      people worthy of the public trust.
     It is these shared qualities that enable the otherwise mismatched
      Special Agents to combine their skills and successfully face all
      sorts of challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show how even the
      smallest team can learn how to communicate, compromise, and
      work together to become much greater than the sum of the
      team's individual parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scully and Mulder's shared trust and complementary tendencies
      enables them to form a resilient, tightly-knit team and
      take on criminals, extra terrestrials, and even their powerful
      bosses at the highest levels of the American government.

    <h4 class="center">The X-Files on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     These portraits are based on the complete series of

       The X-Files</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the story above delineates, the pairing of opposite
      personalities helps give
      <span class="series-title">The X-Files</span> its enduring quality.
     The show is so unique that, if another series came along with similar
      characters, many people would no doubt see it as a rip-off.
    </p>
    <p>
     The powerful and enlightening dynamic between Dana Scully and
      Fox Mulder makes recommending the series to everyone a
      total no-brainer!
