     The abstract images above are “Grojas¹” depicting the personalities
      of the X-Files’ fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
     These spiritual portraits show how they have opposite personalities,
      but are flexible enough to get along.
    </p>
    <p>
     The warm Red and deep Blue in Mulder’s image contrasts strongly with
      the cool Green and flat Yellow in Scully’s portrait.
     The following story describes how these qualities combine to make this
      two-person team uniquely capable to handle even the most bizarre
      situations.

     The long horizontal Red line near the bottom of Mulder’s portrait
      depicts his preference for making emotional decisions.
     This preference is most obvious in his decision to dedicate his life
      to learning what happened to his beloved half-sister,
      whom he believes was abducted by aliens.
     For obvious reasons, he keeps this goal mostly to himself, leading his
      colleagues to be suspicious of his motives and mock him with the
      nickname “Spooky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait is full of Green, the opposite of
      Red, depicting her preference for logical decisions.
     This is an important preference for people who take on the role of a
      guardian to have, because incarcerating someone based on an
      emotion &mdash; a feeling or superstition of some sort &mdash;
      is obviously wrong.
     In an organization like the FBI Scully can, unlike Mulder,
      easily afford to be vocal in expressing her preference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fox and Dana also see the world differently.
     The Blue in Mulder’s image represents his openness to ideas &mdash;
      his willingness to <q>want to believe</q> not just in aliens,
      but in all sorts of paranormal activities.
     It is Mulder’s openness to these ideas that makes the X-Files
      so different from the standard police procedurals such as Dragnet,
      Hill Street Blues, and the various Law and Order and CSI series.
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, Scully’s portrait has more Yellow &mdash; the opposite of
      Blue &mdash; depicting her preference for facts.
     This is preference is only natural for people in authoritarian positions
      to have, because incarcerating someone based on ideas rather than
      facts is clearly an abuse of power.
     Thankfully, witches and heretics no longer have to suffer being burned
      at the stake, at least not in most of today’s moder, civilized countries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As is the case with logical decision making, people are prone to
      expect law enforcement officers to have a preference for facts over
      ideas &mdash; because everyone else can see them.
     Ideas, on the other hand, are more often than not in the mind of
      the beholder.
     So again, Dana can afford to express her pragmatic perceptions,
      while Mulder is best off keeping his ideas to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fox Mulder’s personality is similar to director Woody Allen’s,
      <span class="movie-title">Taxi Driver’s</span>
      Travis Bickle, and my own.
     Dana Scully’s personality is similar to Alexander Hamilton’s,
      Tony Soprano’s, Jamie Lannister's on Game of Thrones, and
      both Presidents Roosevelt.
     Although they say opposites attract, it’s difficult to imagine Woody
      Allen being buddies with Teddy Roosevelt, or Travis Bickle teaming
      up with Tony Soprano to do ... what?
     What would they even talk about, much less plan together?
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Mulder and Scully survive several hair-raising, life-threatening
      experiences, they establish trust in each other and form a team
      unlike any other.
     It is important to note that these primitive images do not depict
      traits such as their ethics and morality &mdash; concern for
      others and a sense of fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like Scully’s preferences for facts and logic, ethics and morality
      are traits we hope to find in people worthy of the public trust.
     It is these shared goals that enable the seemingly mismatched Scully
      and Mulder to combine their skills and successfully face any
      challenge, whether it is real, unreal, or something in between.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is this pairing of opposite personalities &mdash; two people who
      manage to find common ground and support each other despite their
      differences &mdash; that gives the X-Files its enduring quality.
     It is so unique that, if another show came along with similar
      characters, many people would no doubt see it as a rip-off.
