     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of Dr. McCoy and
      Mr. Spock from the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a half-human and half-Vulcan Chief Science Officer,
      Mr. Spock uses logic to suppress
      his emotions.
     As the starship's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. McCoy is more knowledgeable
      about people than things.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Spock and McCoy</h4>
    <p>
     The two are archetypal characters on a classic show, and they
      demonstrate a powerful dichotomy in the human psyche.
     The contrast between these images shows a fundamental difference in
      the way people make decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Spock is the science officer aboard the Starship Enterprise, and
      the Green in his spiritual portrait depicts his preference for making
      logical decisions.
     He is highly intelligent, and has dedicated his life to understanding
      science and knowing how machines work.
     Spock’s cool, calm mantra is “It’s logical,” and as one of ship captain
      James T. Kirk’s most trusted advisors, he functions as the Enterprise’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. Leonard McCoy is the chief medical officer aboard the Starship
      Enterprise, and the Red in his spiritual portrait depicts his
       preference for making emotional decisions.
     He is passionate and has dedicated his life to working with and
      healing people.
     McCoy’s heated, passionate mantra is “Dammit, Jim!”  and as another of
      ship captain James T. Kirk’s most trusted advisors, he functions as
       the Enterprise’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Green and Red</h4>
    <p>
     The decision to use Green to represent what Carl Jung called the Thinking
      mental function was a no-brainer.
     As the painter Wassily Kandinsky observed, Green “is the most restful
      color, lacking any undertone of joy, grief, or passion.”
     It is the color of chlorophyll and hence the color of plants, which are
      necessary to support life as we know it on the planet.
     It is the color of Mr. Spock’s blood and, in American culture,
      it is also the color of money.
     Is it mere coincidence it is the color celebrated in the cruel logic of
      Saint Patrick’s day, If you don’t wear Green, then you will get pinched?
    </p>
    <p>
     Most importantly – at least when it comes to visualizing personalities –
      Green is the opposite of Red.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is likewise only natural to choose Red to represent what Carl Jung
      called the Feeling mental function.
     Red conveys warmth, and is the color of fire and blood, of the
      heart and of love.
     The passion we feel for someone we hate and for people we
      “like-like” makes us feel warm, as blood flows increase and prepare
      us for fight, flight, or love-making.
     In our culture it also happens to be the color of Valentine’s Day and
      the “red-light” districts, where people can exchange cool, Green money
      for warm, Red “love.”
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Head and Heart</h4>
    <p>
     Mr. Spock exemplifies the cool, calm, rationality of logical
      decision-making, and his spiritual portrait reflects this with its
      massive amount of Green.
     His image also contains some Red, reflecting the fact that he does have
      some emotions, but he does his best to keep these emotions to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. McCoy likewise exemplifies the warm, fiery, passion of emotional
      decision-making, and his spiritual portrait reflects this with its
      ample amounts of Red.
     His image contains very little Green, indicating his preference for
      the emotion of humans is at least as strong, if not stronger, than
      Spock’s preference for the logic of the Vulcans.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Yellow in their portraits represents the fact that both Spock and
      McCoy share a preference for pragmatism.
     This enables them to work well together despite their differences.
     They can see things the same way, they just frequently differ on
      what to do about it.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Captain Kirk</h4>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk is wise to seek the advice of two people who have
      such different temperaments.
     As a leader, he frequently sides with Mr. Spock, because often the
      logical thing to do is indeed the best thing to do.
     But he never fails to consult with Dr. McCoy, and he always considers
      the lives of his crew to be more important than his own.
     One could say that James T. Kirk is more passionate about his crew’s
      lives than he is about his own – and hence he is more than worthy of
      his crew’s respect and allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon after the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series began airing, viewers
      responded very positively to Mr. Spock’s character.
     In 1967 the Boston Globe coined the term “Spockmania” in an effort to
      describe this response.
     Series creator Gene Roddenberry once claimed that the number one
      request of fans was for more conflict between him and his foil,
       Dr. Leonard McCoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is of course because many of us feel this conflict between logic
      and emotion, and hence find seeing this internal torment played out in a
      dramatic series as enlightening, and almost like looking into our own minds.

     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
