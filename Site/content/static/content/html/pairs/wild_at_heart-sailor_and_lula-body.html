    <h4 class="center">Opening With a Bang</h4>
    <p>
     Released on August 17<span classs="ordinal">th</span>, 1991,
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span>
      opens with a violent <em><u>bang</u></em> that sets the tone
      for the rest of the film.
    </p>
    <p>
     Admittedly a bit brutal in his defense of himself,
      Sailor Ripley is nonetheless more of a victim than a perpetrator.
     He quickly pays his debt to society and the film starts in
      earnest when Lula picks him up at the
      Pee Dee Correctional Facility.
     Without further ado, the couple puts all the
      ugliness behind them and rides off in Lula's
      black Thunderbird convertible to see their favorite band,
      the speed-metal group <em>Powermad</em>, at the Hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their happiness at being reunited is palpable, and they
      seem ready to finally enjoy their life together.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">A Sweet Couple</h5>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Yellow and Blue in their spiritual portraits
      shows Sailor and Lula are a very sweet couple.
     They bear no one any ill will and are open to just
      about everyone and anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lula and Sailor truly enjoy life in each others'
      company, and they spend their time chatting about the past
      rather than planning for the future.
     When it comes time to be decisive, their strong
      feelings dominate the decisions they make.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their innocence and passion make it easy for anyone
      who has ever been young and in love to relate to them.
     Unfortunately, if Marietta Fortune was ever young and
      in love, it must have been so long ago that she has
      completely forgotten that blissful feeling.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">A Determined Mom</h5>
    <p>
     What Sailor and Lula lack in decision-making ability is
      more than made up for by Lula's mom Marietta.
    </p>
    <p>
     For reasons revealed as the film progresses, Marietta
      has become obsessed with seeing
      Lula obey her decision to stay away from Sailor.
     As a teenager who is hopelessly and completely in
      love, Lula demonstrates time and again she has
      absolutely no intention of cooperating with her
      domineering mom, regardless of her mom's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be difficult to create Marietta Fortune's
      spiritual portrait. because her character is not
      sufficiently developed in the film.
     However, it's clear that passion dominates her personality
      as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there was a way to get to know Marietta better,
      an image of her personality would certainly be full of Red.
     She rarely demonstrates any openness towards anyone,
      except superficially, when it comes time to manipulate
      a hapless accomplice.
     Certainly the way Lynch uses Red as a motif throughout
      the film &mdash; particularly in scenes relating to
      Marietta &mdash; is more synchronicity than coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blinded by her prejudice, Marietta cannot see that Lula and
      Sailor just want to be left alone.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">
     <span class="foreign-term">Amour Fou</span> &mdash; In Hell
    </h4>
    <p>
     The relationship between Sailor and Lula is an excellent
      example of <q class="foreign-term">amour fou,</q>&nbsp;
      French for <q class="italic">insane love.</q>
     Precedents for a couple in love fleeing authoritarian
      figures appear in the 1950 film noir
      <span class="movie-title">Guncrazy</span>, and
      the famous gangster film, 1967's
      <span class="movie-title">Bonnie and Clyde.</span>
     Despite the superficial similarity, though, the
      <span class="foreign-term">amour fou</span> in
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span> is
      far from being derivative of those earlier masterpieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one thing, Lula and Sailor are comparatively innocent:
      Sailor has fully paid the price for being a
      <q class="slang">manslaughterer,</q> and Lula is
      guilty only of being passionately in love with a man whom
      her mom refuses to accept.
     For another, in their attempt to escape Marietta's intolerance,
      Lula and Sailor find themselves in Hell.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">The Inside Scoop</h5>

     For anyone looking for more about
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span>
      than the film itself offers, there's

         class="document-title" target="_blank">
       Weirdsville USA: The Obsessive Universe of David Lynch,</a>
      by Paul A. Woods.
     Published in 2000, the book has a chapter covering
      each of Lynch's most popular early films, starting with
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rogkxt" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
       Eraserhead</a>
      in 1977 and ending with 1999's
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2RwCQEd" class="movie-title" target="_blank">
       Mulholland Drive</a>.
     The chapter
      <span class="document-title">Wild at Heart: Lynch Mob Rules</span>
      appears sandwiched between the two chapters &mdash; one for each
      season &mdash; in the book for
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2RtlcBq" class="series-title" target="_blank">
       Twin Peaks</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     In <span class="document-title">Weirdsville USA</span>,
      Paul A. Woods reveals what the director had to say about
      the film's <q class="from-book">big theme:</q>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     For those who were looking for the big theme,
      <span class="movie-title">Wild at Heart</span> was,
      Lynch assured them,
      <q class="from-book underline">... about finding love in Hell.</q>
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;David Lynch, quoted in
      <span class="book-title">Weirdsville USA</span> by
      Paul A. Woods, 2000, p.128.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     This one bit of insight helps explain some of the
      seemingly unrelated and otherwise anomalous scenes in the film,
      such as an apparently random automobile accident and Lula's
      frustration at not being able to find a suitable radio station.
    </p>
    <p>
     For fans of David Lynch, the book is great in that it contains
      lots of inside information like this.
     Another interesting tidbit from the book that fans will
      appreciate is,
      Laura Dern &mdash; who plays Lula, is the daughter
      in real life of Diane Ladd &mdash; who plays
      Lula's mom Marietta.

     David Lynch was able to complete the film in time to enter it in
      the Cannes Film Festival.
     There it won the <span class="foreign-term">Palme d'Or</span> or
      <q class="italic">Golden Palm</q> &mdash; the highest
      award granted at the festival.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wild at Heart was r.
     Released on August 17, 1990
     Lynch's previous film,
      Blue Velvet,
       appeared in 1986 and the first season of
      Twin Peaks
      had just aired in April and May of 1990.
     Americans presumably were expecting something more like his other
      work during that time, because it did not do well at the box office.

       Fox Mulder’s personality is similar to director Woody Allen’s,

       Dana Scully’s personality is similar to Alexander Hamilton’s,
