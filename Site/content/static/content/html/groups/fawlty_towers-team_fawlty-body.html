     The images above are spiritual portraits or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of characters on the show
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHUWxr" class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     Basil Fawlty and his wife Sybil run a fictional
      hotel named Fawlty Towers in southern England.
     Polly serves as the hotel's chambermaid, receptionist and waitress, and
      Manuel is the bellboy and waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show that the team at
      Fawlty Towers is diverse and interdependent.
     Each team member contributes their own personal set of unique skills,
      making the team capable, robust, and resilient.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Welcome to Fawlty Towers</h4>
    <p>
     Basil's most distinctive quality on this team is his objectivity &mdash;
      represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait.
     The Yellow represents his openness, and this openness takes precedence.
     As the owner he is also ostensibly the boss, but in reality he is
      frequently distracted by
      schemes,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      making him largely unsuited for the role.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil's most distinctive quality on this team is her decisiveness &mdash;
      represented by the Red and Green in her spiritual portrait.
     As Basil's wife, her role is ostensibly to support him,
      but in reality her decisiveness makes her the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly's most distinctive quality on this team is her idealism &mdash;
      represented by the Blue in her spiritual portrait.
     Her ability to think outside of the box enables her to be much more
      than a maid, receptionist, and waitress.
     Ultimately her creativity plays a critical role in assisting Basil
      execute and cover up his schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manuel's most distinctive quality on this team is his warmth &mdash;
      represented by the Yellow in his spiritual portrait.
     He is very likeable, relatable, devoted to Basil, and
      eager to help out any way he can.

     The Yellow in Basil's portrait shows he can get bored easily, and the
      Green shows he's can be a schemer.
     The Red and Green in Sybil's image shows she's the decisive one
      in &mdash; and the real boss of &mdash; Team Fawlty.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue in Polly's image shows she can be good at coming up with
      fresh ideas to help keep Basil from getting in trouble.
     The Red in her and Manuel's images show they're both amiable,
      and they show this by helping Basil when they can.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ostensibly a manual job, it turns out her duties are challenging both emotionally and intellectually — and Polly proves herself uniquely qualified for the role.
    </p>
    <p>
     A character with less openness — and with less Yellow and Blue in their portrait — would quickly leave this position for another.
     Manuel may be the low man on the Fawlty Towers totem pole, but he plays an important role.
     He's dedicated, hard working, and his character is

     Full of Blue and Yellow, Basil’s portrait reveals his openness and
      a strong desire for stimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
     His need to break free causes him to fall prey to Sybil's domineering manner, which in turn makes him emotional to the point of being manic.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it’s trying to appeal to a higher class of customer, save
      a little money on construction costs, or place a bet on a horse
      after hearing about a sure thing,
     Basil’s carelessness, haplessness, and bad luck never fail to get
      the best of him.
     Despite Sybil’s best efforts – or quite possibly because of them – he
      time and again fails to learn a lesson, and as a result, hilarity ensues.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full of Red and Green, Sybil’s portrait stands in stark contrast to
      Basil’s.
     It reveals her confidence, decisiveness, and a need to control others,
      but she is willing to actually lift a finger and help out – albeit
      begrudgingly – during emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil’s mantra is “I know, I know,” and she is too busy fussing with her
      hair and nails to care for any of Basil’s schemes.
     If only Basil would just obey her every demand, and not stray into
      his hare-brained schemes, the
      <span class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</span>
      universe would be perfect &mdash;
      and no doubt the show would be incredibly boring.
    </p>
    <p>
     The contrast between Basil and Sybil’s personalities is just one of the
      aspects of the show that puts it in the #1 position on the BFI
      TV 100 – the list of the top 100 TV shows compiled by the British
      Film Institute in
      2000.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
     The supporting characters – Manuel the linguistically challenged
      busboy, bellboy and outlet for Basil’s wrath, and Polly the maid,
      hostess, art student and primary voice of reason – each lend a
      hand in trying to keep the chaos Basil’s scheming causes
      from Sybil’s watchful, critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Manuel and Polly helping them, Basil and Sybil form a unique
      team: Team Fawlty.
     Together the four of them are capable of handling almost any situation,
      including health inspectors, drunk contractors, Germans, possible
      marital infidelity, and even the occasional dead guest.</p>
    <p>
     Working together, Team Fawlty is capable of just about
      anything – anything, that is, except making a simple Waldorf Salad.
