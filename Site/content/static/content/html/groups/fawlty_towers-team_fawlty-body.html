     The images above are spiritual portraits or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of characters on the British sitcom
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHUWxr" class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show that the team at
      Fawlty Towers is diverse and interdependent.
     Each team member contributes their own personal set of unique skills,
      making the team capable, robust, and resilient.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Welcome to Fawlty Towers</h4>
    <p>
      Basil Fawlty and his wife Sybil
      run a fictional hotel named Fawlty Towers in southern England.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly Sherman serves as the hotel's chambermaid, receptionist
      and waitress, and Manuel is the porter and a waiter.

        target='_blank'>
      Basil's
     </a>
      most distinctive quality on this team is his slight preference for
      being objective and rational &mdash;
      represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait.
     The Yellow represents his openness, and this desire for
      new experiences is stronger than his tendency to be logical.
     As the owner and namesake of Fawlty Towers, Basil is also
      ostensibly the boss, but in reality he isfrequently distracted by
      schemes,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      making him largely unsuited for the role.

         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Sybil Fawlty on www.SeeOurMinds.com'
         target='_blank'>
      Sybil's
     </a>
      most distinctive quality on this team is her decisiveness &mdash;
      represented by the Red and Green in her spiritual portrait.
     The Green shows she is capable of working with the logistics of
      running a hotel,
      and the Red shows she is confident working with people.
     As Basil's wife, her role is ostensibly to support him,
      but in reality her decisiveness makes her the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he's bored, Basilâ€™s openness turns into a craving for stimulation.
     Meanwhile, Sybil's confidence and closed mind stifles him and
      only intensifies his need for some sort of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Worse, in times of crisis Basil frequently finds it impossible to
      communicate with her.
     His frustration causes him lose his ability to be reasonable
      and, as it increases, makes him emotional to the point of being manic.

         target='_blank'>
      Polly's
     </a>
      most distinctive quality on this team is her idealism &mdash;
      represented by the Blue in her spiritual portrait.
     Her ability to think outside of the box enables her to be much more
      than a maid, receptionist, and waitress.
     Ultimately her creativity plays a critical role in assisting Basil
      execute and cover up his schemes and mistakes.

         target='_blank'>
      Manuel's
     </a>
      most distinctive qualities on this team are his
      warmth and openness &mdash;
      represented by the Red and Yellow in his spiritual portrait.
     He is very likeable and relatable, eager to help out any way he can, and
      totally devoted to Basil, despite Basil's mistreatment of him.
     Anyone less open than Manuel would quickly leave the thankless,
      abusive Basil for another position elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red in Polly's and Manuel's images show they're both amiable, and
      they show this in their friendliness towards the guests and
      by helping Basil in any way they can.
     The team at Fawlty Towers may be small, but
      it is diverse and effective.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Three Teams in One</h4>
    <p>
     The team at Fawlty Towers has three modes of operation:
    </p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">
      Day-to-day mode &mdash; when everything is running smoothly
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Agitated mode &mdash; when things are not working properly or
       a guest is unhappy
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Crisis mode &mdash; when Sybil and Basil are
       having difficulty communicating
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The segments in day-to-day mode are quite boring, and
      don't last very long.
     The show gets interesting when they are in agitated mode, and
      it is funniest when the team is in full-on crisis mode.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Day-to-Day Mode</h5>
    <p>
     When things are running smoothly, Basil, Polly, and Manuel know their
      duties and perform them well.
     This leaves Sybil free to read a romance novel, gossip on the phone
      with a friend, and tend to her hair and nails.
    </p>
    <p>
     In day-to-day mode, Polly finds time to express her creativity by drawing
      portraits of her coworkers.
     Viewers do not get to really see much of her work, but in the
      second episode of the series,
      <span class="episode-title">The Builders</span>.
      Basil picks up her sketch pad and describes her latest drawing:
     <q class="dialog">Old soup tins, busted down car, dustbins,
      mattresses, hoovers, and a nice smart collar and tie underneath.
      I mean, what's it's supposed to be?</q>
     Although Basil looks closely enough at the drawing to furnish
      that detailed description of it &mdash; and actually touches his own
      tie as he mentions the one in the drawing &mdash; he fails to realize
      the image is of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The calm moments also give the Spanish-speaking Manuel time to
      improve his English.
     Seeing his optimism and happiness when trying to fit in is delightful.
     The language barrier and Manuel's willingness to put up with Basil's
      abuse makes him seem a bit simple-minded, but he's got more on
      the ball than many realize.
     For example, a bit later in
      <span class="episode-title">The Builders</span>,
      when Basil leaves and Polly displays her drawing in the lobby,
      Manuel immediately identifies it as a portrait of their boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The relative calm of day-to-day mode is always short-lived.
     Inevitably some difficulty with a guest arises or
      Basil's ennui gets him into trouble &mdash; or both.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Agitated Mode</h5>
    <p>
     When things start getting difficult, the members of Team Fawlty
      start to shine.
    </p>
    <p>
     An example of an agitated Fawlty Towers comes
      in the second season's fourth episode,
      <span class="episode-title">The Kipper and the Corpse</span>,
      when a guest dies in his sleep.
     Demonstrating the relationship between tragedy and comedy, this episode
      makes the poor man's passing totally hilarious!
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously Basil must try to hide the corpse from the other
      guests &mdash; to prevent upsetting them unnecessarily, of course.
     As he moves it from room, Polly shows her creativity by quickly coming up
      with off-the-wall, barely plausible explanations of
      Basil's bizarre, anxious behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil also deigns to do her part for a change,
      turning on the charm when consoling a
      long-term guest who happens to see the dead man.
     And of course Manuel lends assistance as well, wearing himself out
      helping Basil carry the body from room to room in an effort
      to keep it out of sight.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Crisis Mode</h5>
    <p>
     Fawlty Towers finds itself in crisis mode quite often, and
      these episodes are some of the most intense &mdash; and
      the most hilarious &mdash; in the series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Basil and Sybil do not have the best relationship, but they've managed
      to stay together for over a decade.
     Their skills are complementary and the hotel functions smoothly
      only when both of them are present.
     When one of them is gone or they are on the outs, everyone suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last episode of season one,
      <span class="episode-title">The Germans</span>,
      opens with Sybil in the hospital.
     Without her oversight and guidance, simple tasks suddenly become extremely
      challenging for the hapless, scatter-brained Basil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crisis mode comes to Fawlty Towers again in the
      fifth episode of season two,
      <span class="episode-title">The Anniversary</span>.
     Basil toys &mdash; quite cruelly, to be honest &mdash; with
      Sybil's emotions, turning what should be a happy, mellow occasion
      into a madcap nightmare for just about
      everyone.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting through these crises requires each member of the team to
      do their best work.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Crises Reveal Hidden Talents</h5>
    <p>
     The long horizontal lines near the bottom of Manuel's and
      Polly's portraits show they are Introverts.
     As such, during times of crisis they often reveal their hidden talents.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly speaks German and Spanish, which helps with guests from the
      continent &mdash; and with Manuel.
     On more than one occasion she effortlessly saves the day with
      her superb language skills.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly can also sing when the situation calls for it, such as
      when the crisis <span class="foreign-term">du jour</span> keeps some
      hungry guests waiting for their meal.
     In one extreme situation she comes to the rescue by reluctantly
      impersonating a missing team member.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manuel can sing and dance, and is happy to help
      distract irate, impatient guests with his latent talents.
     In one episode Manuel reveals he likes to cook, promising to use
      his mother's recipe to make paella for the Fawlty's anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
     The show contains a lot of slapstick, or what John Cleese &mdash;
      the show's creator and star &mdash; calls
      <q class="slang">physical humor.</q>
     As the low man on the totem pole, Manuel bears the brunt of this
      physical abuse, and he was actually injured twice.
     In one episode Cleese, in his role as Basil,
      accidentally hits Manuel with a real frying pan
      instead of a fake one, and in another Andrew Sachs &mdash; the actor
      who plays Manuel &mdash; suffers second degree burns.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Each Team Member Is Important</h4>
    <p>
     Because it is small, interdependent, and diverse, the team at
      Fawlty Towers is very fragile.
     Losing even just one member would cause the fictional hotel,
      the real show, or both to lose their effectiveness and even fall apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     First of all, without Mr. Fawlty there would be no Fawlty Towers.
     He manages to get the essential aspects of the job done &mdash;
      despite the challenges he is constantly facing &mdash; given the
      help of Polly and Manuel, and in spite of his wife's overbearing nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without Sybil, the entire team would be at risk of total failure.
     At a minimum the team would need a new leader &mdash; someone to
      provide the decisiveness that the other members lack &mdash; to guide it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without Polly's idealism and creativity, Basil would lose his main
      partner in crime.
     On his own, he would probably fall into despair and might even
      take his own life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without Manuel the entire team would suffer, and again it is Basil
      who would suffer the most.
     With a suitable replacement, Fawlty Towers the hotel could survive
      the loss, but Fawlty Towers the show most certainly would not.
