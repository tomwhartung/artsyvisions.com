     The abstract images above are spiritual portraits or
      <em>Grojas</em><sup><a href="#notes">[1]</a></sup>
      depicting the personalities of
      the fictional characters  Basil and Sybil Fawlty, who run a fictional
      hotel in southern England known as Fawlty Towers.
     These spiritual portraits show a henpecked, even frightened, yet
      determined schemer and his decisive, condescending, manipulative wife.

     The Yellow in Basil's portrait shows he can get bored easily, and the
      Green shows he's can be a schemer.
     The Red and Green in Sybil's image shows she's the decisive one
      in &mdash; and the real boss of &mdash; Team Fawlty.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue in Polly's image shows she can be good at coming up with
      fresh ideas to help keep Basil from getting in trouble.
     The Red in her and Manuel's images show they're both amiable,
      and they show this by helping Basil when they can.

     Full of Blue and Yellow, Basil’s portrait reveals his openness and
      a strong desire for stimulation. He is , ostensibly the manager but
      largely unsuited for the role.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it’s trying to appeal to a higher class of customer, save
      a little money on construction costs, or place a bet on a horse
      after hearing about a sure thing,
     Basil’s carelessness, haplessness, and bad luck never fail to get
      the best of him.
     Despite Sybil’s best efforts – or quite possibly because of them – he
      time and again fails to learn a lesson, and as a result, hilarity ensues.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full of Red and Green, Sybil’s portrait stands in stark contrast to
      Basil’s.
     It reveals her confidence, decisiveness, and a need to control others,
      but she is willing to actually lift a finger and help out – albeit
      begrudgingly – during emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil’s mantra is “I know, I know,” and she is too busy fussing with her
      hair and nails to care for any of Basil’s schemes.
     If only Basil would just obey her every demand, and not stray into
      his hare-brained schemes, the Fawlty Towers universe would be
      perfect – and no doubt the show would be incredibly boring.
    </p>
    <p>
     The contrast between Basil and Sybil’s personalities is just one of the
      aspects of the show that puts it in the #1 position on the BFI
      TV 100 – the list of the top 100 TV shows compiled by the British
      Film Institute in 2000.<sup><a href="#notes">[2]</a></sup>
     The supporting characters – Manuel the linguistically challenged
      busboy, bellboy and outlet for Basil’s wrath, and Polly the maid,
      hostess, art student and primary voice of reason – each lend a
      hand in trying to keep the chaos Basil’s scheming causes
      from Sybil’s watchful, critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Manuel and Polly helping them, Basil and Sybil form a unique
      team: Team Fawlty.
     Together the four of them are capable of handling almost any situation,
      including health inspectors, drunk contractors, Germans, possible
      marital infidelity, and even the occasional dead guest.</p>
    <p>
     Working together, Team Fawlty is capable of just about
      anything – anything, that is, except making a simple Waldorf Salad.
