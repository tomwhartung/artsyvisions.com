     The images above are spiritual portraits or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of characters on the show
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHUWxr" class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     These spiritual portraits show that the team at
      Fawlty Towers is diverse and interdependent.
     Each team member contributes their own personal set of unique skills,
      making the team capable, robust, and resilient.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Welcome to Fawlty Towers</h4>
    <p>
     Basil Fawlty and his wife Sybil run a fictional
      hotel named Fawlty Towers in southern England.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly serves as the hotel's chambermaid, receptionist and waitress, and
      Manuel is the porter and a waiter.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Meet the Bosses</h5>
    <p>
     Basil's most distinctive quality on this team is his objectivity &mdash;
      represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait.
     The Yellow represents his openness, and this openness takes precedence.
     As the owner he is also ostensibly the boss, but in reality he is
      frequently distracted by
      schemes,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
      making him largely unsuited for the role.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil's most distinctive quality on this team is her decisiveness &mdash;
      represented by the Red and Green in her spiritual portrait.
     The Green shows she is capable of working with the logistics of
      running a hotel,
      and the Red shows she is confident working with people.
     As Basil's wife, her role is ostensibly to support him,
      but in reality her decisiveness makes her the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he's bored, Basil’s openness turns into a desire for stimulation, and
      Sybil's confidence and closed mind only intensifies his need for
      some sort of escape.
     Worse, in times of crisis Basil frequently finds it impossible to
      communicate with her.
     His frustration causes him lose his ability to be reasonable
      and, as it increases, makes him emotional to the point of being manic.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Meet the Workers</h5>
    <p>
     Polly's most distinctive quality on this team is her idealism &mdash;
      represented by the Blue in her spiritual portrait.
     Her ability to think outside of the box enables her to be much more
      than a maid, receptionist, and waitress.
     Ultimately her creativity plays a critical role in assisting Basil
      execute and cover up his schemes and mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manuel's most distinctive qualities on this team are his
      warmth and openness &mdash;
      represented by the Red and Yellow in his spiritual portrait.
     He is very likeable and relatable, eager to help out any way he can, and
      totally devoted to Basil, despite Basil's mistreatment of him.
     Anyone less open than Manuel would quickly leave his thankless,
      abusive for another position someplace else.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Red in Polly's and Manuel's images show they're both amiable, and
      they show this in their friendliness towards the guests and
      by helping Basil in any way they can.

    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Three Teams in One</h4>
    <p>
     The team at Fawlty Towers has three modes of operation:
    </p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">
      Day-to-day mode &mdash; when everything is running smoothly
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Agitated mode &mdash; when things are not working properly or
       a guest is unhappy
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Crisis mode &mdash; when Sybil and Basil are
       having difficulty communicating
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The segments in day-to-day mode are quite boring, and
      don't last very long.
     The show gets interesting when they are in agitated mode, and
      it is funniest when the team is in full-on crisis mode.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Day-to-Day Mode</h5>
    <p>
     When things are running smoothly, Basil, Polly, and Manuel know their
      duties and perform them well.
     This leaves Sybil free to read a romance novel, gossip on the phone
      with a friend, and attend to her hair and nails.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this mode, Polly finds time to express her creativity by drawing
      portraits of her coworkers.
     Viewers do not get to really see her work, but in the second episode
      of the series,
      <span class="episode-title">The Builders</span>.
      Basil picks up her sketch pad and describes her latest drawing:
     <q class="dialog">Old soup tins, busted down car, dustbins,
      mattresses, hoovers, and a nice smart collar and tie underneath.
      I mean, what's it's supposed to be?</q>
     Although Basil looks closely enough at the drawing to furnish
      that detailed description of it, he fails to recognize himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The calm moments also give the Spanish-speaking Manuel time to
      improve his English.
     Seeing his optimism and happiness at fitting in is delightful.
     The language barrier and Manuel's willingness to put up with Basil's
      abuse makes him seem a bit simple-minded, but he's got more on
      the ball than many realize.
     For example, later in the same scene in
      <span class="episode-title">The Builders</span>,
      Polly displays her drawing in the lobby after Basil leaves, and
      Manuel immediately identifies it as a portrait of their boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The relative calm of day-to-day mode is always short-lived.
     Inevitably some difficulty with a guest arises or
      Basil's ennui gets him into trouble.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Agitated Mode</h5>
    <p>
     When things start getting difficult, the members of Team Fawlty
      start to shine.
    </p>
    <p>
     An example of an agitated Fawlty Towers comes
      in the second season's fourth episode,
      <span class="episode-title">The Kipper and the Corpse</span>,
      when a guest dies in his sleep.
     Demonstrating the relationship between tragedy and comedy, this episode
      makes the poor man's passing totally hilarious!
    </p>
    <p>
     When Basil tries to hide the corpse from other guests &mdash; to
      prevent upsetting them unnecessarily &mdash;
      Polly shows her creativity by quickly coming up
      with explanations of Basil's bizarre, anxious behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil does her part, turning on the charm when consoling a
      long-term guest when she happens to see the dead man.
     And of course Manuel lends assistance as well, wearing himself out
      helping Basil carry the body from room to room in an effort
      to keep it out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Crisis Mode</h5>
    <p>
     Fawlty Towers finds itself in crisis mode quite often, and
      these episodes are some of the most intense &mdash; and
      the most hilarious &mdash; in the series.
     When one of them is gone or they are on the outs, everyone suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last episode of season one,
      <span class="episode-title">The Germans</span>,
      opens with Sybil in the hospital.
     Without her oversight and guidance, simple tasks suddenly become extremely
      challenging for the hapless, scatter-brained Basil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crisis mode comes to Fawlty Towers again in the
      fifth episode of season two,
      <span class="episode-title">The Anniversary</span>.
     Basil toys &mdash; quite cruelly, to be honest &mdash; with
       Sybil's emotions, turning what should be a happy occasion into a
       hilarious, madcap nightmare for just about
       everyone.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Basil and Sybil do not have the best relationship, but they've managed
      to stay together for over a decade.
     Their skills are complementary and the hotel functions smoothly
      only when both of them are present.
     Getting through these crises requires each member of the team to
      do their best work.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center">Crises Reveal Hidden Talents</h5>
    <p>
     The long horizontal lines near the bottom of Manuel's and
      Polly's portraits show they are Introverts.
     As such, during times of crisis they frequently reveal hidden talents.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polly speaks German and Spanish, which helps with guests from the
      continent &mdash; and with Manuel &mdash; effortlessly saving the
      day with her superb language skills on more than one occasion.
     She can also carry a tune when the situation calls for it, such as
      when the crisis <span class="foreign-term">du jour</span> keeps some
      hungry guests waiting for their meal.
     In one extreme circumstance Polly actually saves the day by reluctantly
      impersonating a missing team member.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manuel can sing and dance, and is happy to help
      distract irate, impatient guests with his latent talents.
     In one episode Manuel reveals he likes to cook,
      promising to use his mother's recipe to
      make paella for a special occasion.
     The show contains a lot of slapstick, or what John Cleese &mdash;
      the show's creator and star &mdash; calls
      <q class="slang">physical humor.</q>
     As the low man on the totem pole, Manuel bears the brunt of this
      physical abuse and he was actually injured twice.
     In one episode Cleese, who by the way plays Basil,
      accidentally hits him with a real frying pan
      instead of a fake one, and in another he suffers second degree burns.

    <h4 class="center">Unused Content</h4>
    <p>
     When things start getting difficult, the members of Team Fawlty
      start to shine.
     For example, in the second season's opening episode,
      <span class="episode-title">Communication Problems</span>,
      a grumpy customer who is hard of hearing quickly exasperates
      each member of the team, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
     First Mrs. Richards insists on interrupting Polly while she is
      busy with another guest, so she refers the guest to Manuel.
     Try as he might, Manuel quickly finds her impossible to deal with
      and calls for Basil.
     Fortunately she is unable to hear most of his insensitive insults,
      and ultimately he fobs her off on Sybil.
     Even Sybil is able to reason with the grumpy guest when she finds
      she's missing some money.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Unused Descriptive Passages</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in Basil's portrait shows he can get bored easily, and the
      Green shows he's can be a schemer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full of Red and Green, Sybil’s portrait stands in stark contrast to
      Basil’s.
     It reveals her confidence, decisiveness, and a need to control others,
      but she is willing to actually lift a finger and help out – albeit
      begrudgingly – during emergencies.
     The Red and Green in Sybil's image shows she's the decisive one
      in &mdash; and the real boss of &mdash; Team Fawlty.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Blue in Polly's image shows she can be good at coming up with
      fresh ideas to help keep Basil from getting in trouble.
     Ostensibly a manual job, it turns out her duties are challenging both emotionally and intellectually — and Polly proves herself uniquely qualified for the role.
     The Red in her and Manuel's images show they're both amiable,
      and they show this by helping Basil when they can.
    </p>
    <p>
     A character with less openness — and with less Yellow and Blue in their portrait — would quickly leave this position for another.
     Manuel may be the low man on the Fawlty Towers totem pole, but he plays an important role.
     He's dedicated, hard working, and his character is
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Basil’s carelessness, haplessness, and bad luck never fail to get
      the best of him.
     Despite Sybil’s best efforts – or quite possibly because of them – he
      time and again fails to learn a lesson, and as a result, hilarity ensues.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sybil’s mantra is “I know, I know,” and she is too busy fussing with her
      hair and nails to care for any of Basil’s schemes.
     If only Basil would just obey her every demand, and not stray into
      his hare-brained schemes, the
      <span class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</span>
      universe would be perfect &mdash;
      and no doubt the show would be incredibly boring.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
     The contrast between Basil and Sybil’s personalities is just one of the
      aspects of the show that puts it in the #1 position on the BFI
      TV 100 – the list of the top 100 TV shows compiled by the British
      Film Institute in
      2000.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     The supporting characters – Manuel the linguistically challenged
      porter, waiter and outlet for Basil’s wrath, and Polly the maid,
      hostess, art student and primary voice of reason – each lend a
      hand in trying to keep the chaos Basil’s scheming causes
      from Sybil’s watchful, critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Manuel and Polly helping them, Basil and Sybil form a unique
      team: Team Fawlty.
     Together the four of them are capable of handling almost any situation,
      including health inspectors, drunk contractors, Germans, possible
      marital infidelity, and even the occasional dead guest.</p>
    <p>
     Working together, Team Fawlty is capable of just about
      anything – anything, that is, except making a simple Waldorf Salad.
