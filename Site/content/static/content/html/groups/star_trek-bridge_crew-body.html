     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of crew members on the bridge
      of the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.

     Lieutenant Uhura is the starship's communications officer,
      Lieutenant Sulu is the ship's helmsman, and Ensign Chekov is
      the navigator.
     The final image is of their boss,

    <h4 class="center">A Diverse Crew?</h4>
    <p>
     The crew is interesting because it is racially diverse during
      a time when American TV was for the most part all-white.
     Uhura is African, Sulu is Asian, and Chekov is Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their personalities are not very diverse, however.
     The images of Sulu's and Chekov's personalities show they
      are very similar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uhuru's image shows she is more emotional than Sulu or Chekov,
      but otherwise similar in temperament.
     It makes sense for her to be more emotional and the others
      more logical, because her position calls for her to work more
      with people, while Sulu and Chekov work more with the ship.

    <p>
     These portraits are based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
