     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of crew members on the bridge
      of the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lieutenant Uhura is the starship's communications officer,
      Lieutenant Sulu is the ship's helmsman, and Ensign Chekov is
      the navigator.
     The final image is of their boss,
      <a href='/visions/story/0010-person-captain_kirk'
         title='Link to the story about Captain Kirk on this site' target='_blank'>
       Captain James T. Kirk</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">A Diverse Crew?</h4>
    <p>
     The crew on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise is
      interesting because it is racially diverse during
      a time when American TV was for the most part all-white.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uhura is African, Sulu is Asian, and Chekov is Russian.
     Although Chekov is White, he was a Russian and thus part of one of
      America's most hated enemies in the 1960s.
     At the time America and Russia were engaged in a Cold War and
      the paranoid McCarthyism of the 1950s was still fresh in
      the public's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the surface, and ignoring the lack of
      very old or very young crew members for the time being,
      this crew is quite diverse &mdash; especially when viewed
      in light of the standards for American television during the 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that's just on the surface.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">A Normal Crew</h4>
    <p>
     The crew on the bridge of the Enterprise do not have
      very diverse personalities, but that's ok.
     Their personalities are very well-suited for their positions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Green and Red dominating Captain Kirk's image represents
      how he's the decisive one &mdash; the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The images of Sulu's and Chekov's personalities show they
      are very similar.
     The Yellow in their spiritual portraits shows they are open
      to new experiences, and the Green shows they prefer working
      with things rather than people.
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes sense for Sulu and Chekov to have similar
      temperaments because, as helmsman and navigator,
      their jobs are very similar.
     Indeed, they work side-by side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uhuru's image shows she is more emotional than Sulu or Chekov,
      but otherwise similar in temperament.
     The Yellow in her spiritual portrait shows she is open
      to new experiences, and the Red shows she prefers working
      with people rather than things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uhuru's portrait shows she is more emotional and the others
      more logical, because her position calls for her to work more
      with people, while Sulu and Chekov work more with the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     The contrast between Uhura's and her crew mates' images is far less
      pronounced than the contrast between the images of
      <a href="/visions/story/0020-pairs-star_trek-spock_and_mccoy"
         title"Article about Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy on this site">
       Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy</a>.
     The images of all three bridge crew members are colorful,
      showing their preferences are moderate and they are all flexible.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">What's Missing?</h4>
    <p>
     None of these spiritual portraits has Blue as its dominating color.
    </p>
    <p>
     The opposite of Yellow &mdash; which appears in significant
      quantities in all of these images &mdash; Blue represents a
      person's tendency to see the world in terms of ideas rather
      than facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no visionaries in the bridge crew of the Enterprise.
     It's not really a good place for visionaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thought: siloed team, frequently taken advantage of by aliens who
      have the power to exert their will over reality - mind over matter.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In the fictional universe of Star Trek, the visionaries are the
      people who created the starship, developed the technology it uses,
      and sent it on its mission.
     The crew on the bridge are not the ones with the vision, but
      the ones fulfilling it.
     They have some Blue, showing they share the vision of those who
      sent them out, but they are of necessity focused on
      the realities of day-to-day life.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the real world, where Star Trek is a TV show struggling for
      ratings, the visionaries are the writers and producers.

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     These portraits are based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
