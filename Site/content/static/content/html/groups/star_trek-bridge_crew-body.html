     The images above are spiritual portraits, or
      <em>Grojas</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     They depict the personalities of crew members on the bridge
      of the Starship Enterprise on
      the Original Star Trek series.

    <p>
     Lieutenant Uhura is the starship's communications officer,
      Lieutenant Sulu is the ship's helmsman, and Ensign Chekov is
      the navigator.
     The final image is of their boss,

    <h4 class="center">A Diverse Crew?</h4>
    <p>
     The crew is interesting because it is racially diverse during
      a time when American TV was for the most part all-white.
     Uhura is African, Sulu is Asian, and Chekov is Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their personalities are not very diverse, however.
     The images of Sulu's and Chekov's personalities show they
      are very similar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uhuru's image shows she is more emotional than Sulu or Chekov,
      but otherwise similar in temperament.
     It makes sense for her to be more emotional and the others
      more logical, because her position calls for her to work more
      with people, while Sulu and Chekov work more with the ship.
