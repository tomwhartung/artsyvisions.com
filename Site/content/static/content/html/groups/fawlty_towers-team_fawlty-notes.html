  A spiritual portrait or <em>Groja</em> &mdash; for
   <strong><u>G</u></strong>raphical <strong><u>R</u></strong>epresentation
   <strong><u>o</u></strong>f <strong><u>J</u></strong>ungian
   <strong><u>A</u></strong>rchetypes &mdash; is an image representing
   the personality of a person.
  Inspired by the pure plastic art of Piet Mondrian, Grojas seek to find

   personality functions Carl Jung detailed in his writings about
   psychological types in the early 1920s.

   impression on some hotel inspectors, wagering some money on a horse after
