   Captain Kirk does not appear in the original pilot episode,
    <span class="episode-title">The Cage.</span>
   When executives decided to pick up the series after airing a second pilot,
    the producers remade this initial pilot into a two-part episode,
    <span class="episode-title">The Menagerie.</span>

   There is just something about D. C. Fontana's manner and the way she
    speaks that makes me want to figure out some way to draw her
    spiritual portrait.
   It would also be great to draw profiles of some of the other commentators,
    such as David Gerrold, David Rossi, and Mike and Denise Okuda.
   Perhaps I will reach out to them someday and politely ask whether they'd
    be interested in satisfying my curiosity!
