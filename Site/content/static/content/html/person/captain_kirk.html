<p>When I created this image, I was a bit surprised to see that Captain Kirk's personality turned out to be so similar to Spock's.  Despite the superficial similarity, it is important to note that Kirk is definitely more Extraverted &mdash; as the large vertical Green line indicates, and a bit more balanced &mdash; in that it is a bit more colorful.</p>
<p>Kirk and Spock's similarity makes sense, though, when you consider the duties performed by all three characters on the starship.  While Kirk and Spock's posts are on the bridge and involve working with the entire ship, McCoy's work as medical officer involves working exclusively with people.</p>
<p>By frequently consulting with McCoy when he faces a tough decision, Kirk shows he is truly wise.</p>
<p>I would expect to find a character with more iNtuition in this series.  I recently found all 80 episodes on DVD for a very reasonable price, and plan to rewatch them and create more images from the series soon.
