      Alexander Hamilton</a>
      was born illegitimately on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in
      Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis
      in the Caribbean Sea.
     He was the youngest of the seven <q>key</q>&nbsp;Founding Fathers and the
      only one of that group who was born outside of the Thirteen Colonies.
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Decision Maker</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Green in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his strong preference for being rational and decisive.
     He demonstrated courage and conviction during the Revolutionary War, and
      his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to
      pursue a career in law.
     </p>
     <p>
     As a youth, he was unable to attend school at the Church of England
      because his parents were unmarried.
     However, he received some tutoring at a private school which he
      was able to supplement with reading his family's books.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton came to America in 1772 &mdash; while he was still
      a teenager &mdash; and after a year or so began studying at
      King's College, now Columbia University.
     While there he learned about and joined the patriots' revolutionary cause,
      and during the war he served as one of

         target='_blank'>
       General George Washington</a>'s
      aides de camp for four years.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Realist</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his realism.
     His desire for a strong fedeal government backed by a
      standing army is an excellent example of this pragmatism.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Washington's aide during the Revolutionary War,
      Hamilton had seen first hand how the lack of
      essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the
      soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.
     America won the war in 1783, but wound up deeply in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Years later, Shay's Rebellion threatened the lives of Americans
      in 1786 and 1787, but by that time the
      country's standing army was miniscule.
     There was not even a plan to repay the debt for the Revolutionary War,
      much less pay for new men and munitions, and
      Hamilton the realist saw it would be very difficult to find new recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">A Complicated Assumption</h4>
    <p>
     Alexander Hamilton turned his world-class reasoning ability and
     fine attention to detail into superhero powers in the late 1780s,
     culminating in the Compromise of 1790.
    </p>
    <p>
     State governments were frequently forced to fund the Revolutionary
      War with notes that were essentially I.O.U.s.
     Some people &mdash; such as farmers who were formerly soldiers and
      needed to buy seeds, for example &mdash; had sold their notes to
      speculators,
      often for mere cents on the dollar.
     And some states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, had paid off
      most of this debt, while other states, such as Massachusetts and
      South Carolina, had heavy debts left yet to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Figuring out a way to make everyone happy in this situation was problematic:
    </p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">
      Should the federal government assume the states' debts
       &mdash; rewarding the states that still had massive debts at the
       expense of the more conscientious ones?
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Should the I.O.U.s be paid off at full face value &mdash; rewarding
       the speculators at the expense of people like the hard-working
       farmer-soldiers?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Hamilton believed the answer to both questions was <q>Yes,</q> and as the nation's first

       his opinions mattered more than anyone else's.  He set forth the facts and his reasoning about them in the

        and delivered the 40,000 word document to Congress on January 9, 1790.</p>
    <h4 class="center">More Push-Back</h4>
    <p>
     Alexander Hamilton's
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit' title='Wikipedia page for the First Report on the Public Credit' target='_blank'>
              Report on the Public Credit</a>,

               push-back</a>.
        A stalemate resulted, with House Representative James Madison and Washington's new
       <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State' title='Wikipedia page describing the position of United States Secretary of State' target='_blank'>
                Secretary of State</a>
        Thomas Jefferson leading the opposition.</p>
    <p>
     Just a few years prior to this, Hamilton had bemoaned the creation of political parties, and the difficulty inherent in trying to change people's opinions, once they've been formed:</p>
    <blockquote>
             [N]othing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties.  In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making
             <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselyte' title='Wikipedia page for proselyte' target='_blank'>
                      proselytes</a>
              by fire and sword.  Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.

      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as

         <em>General Introduction,</em> October 27, 1787.</blockquote>
    <h4 class="center">Dinner Time!</h4>
    <p>
     The stalemate over assumption ended on June 20, 1790, when Alexander Hamilton sat down to dinner with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and to discuss the situation.  During this famous conversation, Jefferson and Madison agreed to acquiesce on the assumption of state debts if Hamilton would agree to move the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol#History' title='Wikipedia page for the nation's capitol, cued to the section on its History' target='_blank'>
              nation's capitol</a>
      south from its original home in
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall' title='Wikipedia page for Federal Hall' target='_blank'>
               Manhattan</a>
       &mdash; a city that some of Hamilton's fans actually wanted to call <em>

                         Hamiltonopolis</a></em>.</p>
    <p>
     With the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Compromise of 1790' target='_blank'>
              Compromise of 1790</a>,
       Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison agreed to pass legislation that would become known as the
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_Act_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Funding Act of 1790' target='_blank'>
               Funding Act of 1790</a>
       and the
       <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act' title='Wikipedia page for Residence Act' target='_blank'>
                Residence Act</a>.
     </p>
    <p>
     The Funding Act called for the assumption of the states' war debts by the Federal Government &mdash; and everything that went along with that.  And the Residence Act called for temporarily moving the nation's capitol from its current home in New York City to
     <a href='http://www.visitphilly.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.visitphilly.com' target='_blank'>
             Philadelphia</a>.
     From there it would move again to a permanent home in
      <a href='https://washington.org/' title='Link to the home page at washington.org' target='_blank'>
              Washington, D.C.</a>,
      a new city on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia.</p>
    <h4 class="center">Party Time!</h4>
    <p>
    A significant side effect of all this was the creation of America's two-party system.  The process started with Jefferson's and Madison's informal
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Administration_party' title='Wikipedia page for Anti-Administration party' target='_blank'>
             Anti-Administration Party</a> in 1789.</p>
    <p>
    Two years later, Alexander Hamilton and his supporters formed the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Party' target='_blank'>
             Federalist Party</a>.
     And a year after that the informal Anti-Administration Party evolved into the formal
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Democratic-Republican Party' target='_blank'>
              Republican Party</a>
      &mdash; known to some historians as the <em>Democratic-Republican Party,</em> and not to be confused with today's
       <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the current Republican Party, aka. as the GOP' target='_blank'>GOP</a>
       &mdash; in 1792.</p>
    <h4 class="center">At Odds With Jefferson</h4>
    <p>
     Where Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside, envisioned a rural,
      agrarian society,
      Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in New York City,
      foresaw large, bustling cities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton's and Jefferson's different attitudes are especially
      evident with regards to the idea of a standing army:</p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to
      our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be,
      we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the
      ambition of others.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <b>Federalist No. 34, The Same Subject Continued:
        Concerning the General Power of Taxation,</b>
     January 4, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     While Jefferson thought the United States could remain neutral
      without a standing military, Hamilton knew this idea was
      dangerously unrealistic.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Ugly Rumors</h4>
    <p>
     Some people claim that Alexander Hamilton and
     <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>
             Thomas Jefferson</a>
     actually <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/david_scott_638754' title='Link to a quote at www.brainyquote.com saying Hamilton and Jefferson hated each other' target='_blank'>hated each other</a>.</q>
     Although this is ultimately a matter of
      <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=semantics' title='Page for the term semantics at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>
              semantics</a>,
      one might reasonably like to think the
       <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/' title='Link to the home page at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>
               Founding Fathers</a>
       were better than that.</p>
    <p>
     Indeed, some recent accounts of their relationship
      <a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/how-hamilton-recasts-thomas-jefferson-as-a-villain/401669/' title='Link to an article asserting that the Hamilton musical casts Jefferson as a villian at www.theatlantic.com' target='_blank'>
             paint Jefferson as a villain</a>.
     However, allegations of <em>hatred</em> are a bit exaggerated.</p>
    <p>
    In
     <a href='https://archive.org/details/completeanastho00sawvgoog' title='Link to Thomas Jeffersons Anas at archive.org' target='_blank'>
             Thomas Jefferson's Anas</a>
     he states Alexander Hamilton was <em><q>honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private.</q></em> This is hardly the language of a <q>hater.</q></p>
    <p>
    Likewise, when Alexander Hamilton helped Jefferson beat Aaron Burr in the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1800' target='_blank'>
             fourth presidential election</a>
     in 1800, he showed he had at least some respect for Jefferson.
     Again, this does not sound like something a <q>hater</q> would do.</p>
    <h4 class="center">No Time for Hate</h4>
    <p>
    When
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr' title='Wikipedia page for Aaron Burr' target='_blank'>
             Aaron Burr</a>
     forced Alexander Hamilton into their

              infamous duel</a>,
      there is

               ample evidence</a>
       that Hamilton
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel#Hamilton&apos;s_intentions' title='Wikipedia page for the Hamilton-Burr duel, cued to the section on Hamiltons intentions' target='_blank'>
                intended</a>
        to throw his shot away.  And if Hamilton actually did
         <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloping#Notable_uses' title='Wikipedia page for Deloping, cued to the section on Notable_uses, which begins by mentioning the Hamilton-Burr duel' target='_blank'>
                 throw away</a>
         his shot on that fateful day, then he effectively died for <em>refusing</em> to <q>hate</q> Burr &mdash; someone who fully intended to <em>kill</em> him &mdash; and someone who, sadly, was successful.</p>
    <p>
    Hate is an emotion, but Hamilton, Jefferson, and Adams were predominantly logical people.  Emotions &mdash; such as those that dominated the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution' title='Wikipedia page for the French Revolution' target='_blank'>
             French Revolution</a>
     around this time &mdash; are the driving force behind mobs.</p>
    <p>
    Although Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot' title='Wikipedia page for Riots' target='_blank'>
             mob violence</a>.
     It is actually the <em>lack</em> of hatred and <em>predominance of reason</em> that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.</p>
    <p>
    Saying the Founding Fathers <q>hated</q> each other sounds shocking because it's
     <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hyperbole' title='Link to the term hyperbole at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>
             hyperbole</a>
     &mdash; essentially
      <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake+news' title='Link to the term fake news at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>
              fake news</a>
      &mdash; at best, a poor choice of words.  If Alexander Hamilton was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a <q>hater,</q> the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.</p>

    <blockquote>
            For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton, who had been condemned to everlasting silence.
