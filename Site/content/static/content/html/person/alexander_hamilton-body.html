     It depicts the personality of Alexander Hamilton, one of America's Founding Fathers.

      Alexander Hamilton</a>
      was born illegitimately on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in
      Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis
      in the Caribbean Sea.
     He was the youngest of the seven <q>key</q>&nbsp;Founding Fathers and the
      only one of that group who was born outside of the Thirteen Colonies.
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Decision Maker</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Green in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his strong preference for being rational and decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton demonstrated courage and conviction during the Revolutionary
      War, and his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to
      pursue a career in law.
     </p>
     <p>
     As a youth, he was unable to attend school at the Church of England
      because his parents were unmarried.
     However, he received some tutoring at a private school which he
      was able to supplement with reading his family's books.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton came to America in 1772 &mdash; while he was still
      a teenager &mdash; and after a year or so began studying at
      King's College, now Columbia University.
     While there he learned about and joined the patriots' revolutionary cause,
      and during the Revolutionary War he served as one of

         target='_blank'>
       General George Washington</a>'s
      aides de camp for four years.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Realist</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his realism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton's desire for a strong fedeal government backed by a
      standing army is an excellent example of his pragmatism.
     As Washington's aide during the Revolutionary War,
      Hamilton had seen first hand how the lack of
      essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the
      soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.
     America won the war in 1783, but wound up deeply in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Years later, Shay's Rebellion threatened the lives of Americans
      in 1786 and 1787, but by that time the
      country's standing army was miniscule.
     There was not even a plan to repay the debt for the Revolutionary War,
      much less pay for new men and munitions, and
      Hamilton the realist saw it would be very difficult to find new recruits.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to
      our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be,
      we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the
      ambition of others.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <b>Federalist No. 34, The Same Subject Continued:
        Concerning the General Power of Taxation,</b>
     January 4, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     As a realist, Hamilton found himself at odds with the idealistic
      Thomas Jefferson, who believed America had no enemies and
      hence did not need an army.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">At Odds With Jefferson</h4>
    <p>
     The image of Alexander Hamilton's decisive, pragmatic personality
      stands in stark constrast to the
      <a href='/visions/story/0040-person-thomas_jefferson'
         title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'
         target='_blank'>
       image of Thomas Jefferson</a>'s
      open and idealistic persona.
     Although both had high hopes for their new nation,
      their backgrounds were as different as their personalities, and
      they disagreed about many things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in
      New York City, foresaw large, bustling cities,
      Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside,
      envisioned a rural, agrarian society.
     While the idealistic Jefferson thought the United States could remain
      neutral without a standing military, the pragmatic Hamilton knew this
      idea was dangerously unrealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people claim that Jefferson and Hamilton
      <q class="dialog">hated each
      other.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     These spiritual portraits show that these two Founding Fathers
      were better than that.
     Hate is an emotion, and if Jefferson and Hamilton harbored
      contempt for each other, their portraits would have more Red.

       John Adams</a>,
      and other Founding Fathers may have been political rivals, but
      they were also predominantly logical people.
     Significantly, they may have disagreed over many things but they
      were all strongly united in their disdain for the sort of
      uncontrolled emotions that could fuel mob violence.

    <p>
     Hamilton's and Jefferson's different attitudes are especially
      evident with regards to the idea of a standing army:</p>
    <h4 class="center">Finding a Compromise</h4>
    <p>
     Alexander Hamilton turned his world-class reasoning ability and
     fine attention to detail into superhero powers in the late 1780s,
     culminating in the Compromise of 1790.
    </p>
    <p>
     State governments were frequently forced to fund the Revolutionary
      War with notes that were essentially I.O.U.s.
     Some people &mdash; such as farmers who were formerly soldiers and
      needed to buy seeds, for example &mdash; had sold their notes to
      speculators,
      often for mere cents on the dollar.
     And some states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, had paid off
      most of this debt, while other states, such as Massachusetts and
      South Carolina, had heavy debts left yet to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Figuring out a way to make everyone happy in this situation was problematic:
    </p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">
      Should the federal government assume the states' debts
       &mdash; rewarding the states that still had massive debts at the
       expense of the more conscientious ones?
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Should the I.O.U.s be paid off at full face value &mdash; rewarding
       the speculators at the expense of people like the hard-working
       farmer-soldiers?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Hamilton believed the answer to both questions was <q>Yes,</q> and as the nation's first

       his opinions mattered more than anyone else's.  He set forth the facts and his reasoning about them in the

        and delivered the 40,000 word document to Congress on January 9, 1790.</p>
    <h4 class="center">More Push-Back</h4>

               push-back</a>.
        A stalemate resulted, with House Representative James Madison and Washington's new

                Secretary of State</a>
        Thomas Jefferson leading the opposition.</p>
    <p>
     Just a few years prior to this, Hamilton had bemoaned the creation of political parties, and the difficulty inherent in trying to change people's opinions, once they've been formed:</p>
    <blockquote>
             [N]othing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties.  In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making

    <h4 class="center">Dinner Time!</h4>
    <p>
     The stalemate over assumption ended on June 20, 1790, when Alexander Hamilton sat down to dinner with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and to discuss the situation.  During this famous conversation, Jefferson and Madison agreed to acquiesce on the assumption of state debts if Hamilton would agree to move the

     With the

              Compromise of 1790</a>,
       Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison agreed to pass legislation that would become known as the
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_Act_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Funding Act of 1790' target='_blank'>
               Funding Act of 1790</a>

                Residence Act</a>.
     </p>
    <p>
     The Funding Act called for the assumption of the states' war debts by the Federal Government &mdash; and everything that went along with that.  And the Residence Act called for temporarily moving the nation's capitol from its current home in New York City to
     <a href='http://www.visitphilly.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.visitphilly.com' target='_blank'>
             Philadelphia</a>.
     From there it would move again to a permanent home in

              Washington, D.C.</a>,
      a new city on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia.</p>
    <h4 class="center">Party Time!</h4>
    <p>
    A significant side effect of all this was the creation of America's two-party system.  The process started with Jefferson's and Madison's informal
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Administration_party' title='Wikipedia page for Anti-Administration party' target='_blank'>
             Anti-Administration Party</a> in 1789.</p>

    Two years later, Alexander Hamilton and his supporters formed the
     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Party' target='_blank'>
             Federalist Party</a>.
     And a year after that the informal Anti-Administration Party evolved into the formal

    <blockquote>
            For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton, who had been condemned to everlasting silence.
