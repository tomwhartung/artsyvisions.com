      Alexander Hamilton</a>
      was born illegitimately on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in
      Charlestown, the capital of the island of Nevis
      in the Caribbean Sea.
     He was the youngest of the seven <q>key</q>&nbsp;Founding Fathers and the
      only one of that group who was born outside of the Thirteen Colonies.
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Decision Maker</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Green in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his strong preference for being rational and decisive.
     He demonstrated courage and conviction during the Revolutionary
      War, and his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to
      pursue a career in law.
     </p>
     <p>
     As a youth, Hamilton was unable to attend school at the Church of England
      because his parents were unmarried.
     However, he received some tutoring at a private school which he
      was able to supplement with reading his family's books.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton came to America in 1772 &mdash; while he was still
      a teenager &mdash; and after a year or so began studying at
      King's College, now Columbia University.
     While there he learned about and joined the patriots' revolutionary cause,
      and during the Revolutionary War he served as one of

       General George Washington</a>'s
      aides de camp for four years.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Hamilton, the Realist</h4>
    <p>
     The Yellow in Alexander Hamilton's spiritual portrait
      represents his realism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hamilton's desire for a strong fedeal government backed by a
      standing army is an excellent example of his pragmatism.
     As Washington's aide during the Revolutionary War,
      Hamilton had seen first hand how the lack of
      essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the
      soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.
     America won the war in 1783, but wound up deeply in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Years later, Shay's Rebellion threatened the lives of Americans
      in 1786 and 1787, but by that time the
      country's standing army was miniscule.
     There was not even a plan to repay the debt for the Revolutionary War,
      much less pay for new men and munitions, and
      Hamilton the realist saw it would be very difficult to find new recruits.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to
      our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be,
      we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the
      ambition of others.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as Publius in
     <b>Federalist No. 34, The Same Subject Continued:
        Concerning the General Power of Taxation,</b>
     January 4, 1788.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     As a realist, Hamilton found himself at odds with the idealistic
      Thomas Jefferson, who believed America had no enemies and
      hence did not need an army.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">At Odds With Jefferson</h4>
    <p>
     The image of Alexander Hamilton's decisive, pragmatic personality
      stands in stark constrast to the
      <a href='/visions/story/0040-person-thomas_jefferson'
         title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'
         target='_blank'>
       image of Thomas Jefferson</a>'s
      open and idealistic persona.
     Although both had high hopes for their new nation,
      their backgrounds were as different as their personalities, and
      they disagreed about many things.
    </p>
    <ul class="collection">
     <li class="collection-item">
      Where Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in
       New York City, foresaw large, bustling cities,
       Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside,
       envisioned a rural, agrarian society
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      While the pragmatic Hamilton saw an immediate need for the
       new nation to pay off the debt from the war and
       establish an army,
       the idealistic Jefferson thought the United States could remain
       neutral and hence did not need a standing military
     </li>
     <li class="collection-item">
      Hamilton admired the structure of the British government, but
       Jefferson thought France &mdash; Britain's enemy in so many wars
       throughout history &mdash;
       had found the right course
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Some people claim that Hamilton and Jefferson
      <q class="dialog">hated each
      other.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     These spiritual portraits show that these two Founding Fathers
      were better than that.
     Hate is an emotion, and if Hamilton and Jefferson harbored
      contempt for each other, their portraits would have more Red.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">America's First Political Parties</h4>
    <p>
     Having won the Revolutionary War, the stoic George Washington was
      immensely popular.
     He was elected unanimously to two terms as the
      1<span class="ordinal">st</span> President of the United States, and
      remains the only person who was <em>not a member of a
      political party</em> to serve in that position.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1797, when Washington's second term came to an end and he refused to
      serve for a third, the politicians in the new country gradually
      began succumbing to the desire to gain power.
     Political rivalry and a touch of ambition &mdash; which the
      Founding Fathers were careful to keep under wraps.
      because humilty was very <q class="slang">in</q>&nbsp; back
      then &mdash; soon enhanced Hamilton's and Jefferson's
      personal differences, bringing them to the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of these differences are visible only in the spiritual portraits of
      Hamilton and Jefferson here and on

         title='Link to the Home page of SeeOurMinds.com' target='_blank'>
       SeeOurMinds.com</a>.
     Eventually these previously invisible differences &mdash; coupled with the
      more superficial, demographic differences of background, occupation, age,
      place of residence, etc. &mdash; led to the formation of America's
      first political parties.

       John Adams</a>,
      and other Founding Fathers may have been political rivals, but
      they were also predominantly logical people.
     Significantly, they may have disagreed over many things but they
      were all strongly united in their disdain for the sort of
      uncontrolled emotions that could fuel mob violence.

     As far as this author is concerned, the idea that any of the
      Founding Fathers
      <q class="dialog">hated each
      other</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
      is hyperbole &mdash; fake news meant to sell rather than inform.

     This spiritual portrait is based on the
      biography
      of Alexander Hamilton by
      Ron Chernow
      (2004).
     There is also an
      American Experience video
      about Hamilton's life, but Chernow's book &mdash; which is over 720 pages long &mdash; is far more comprehensive.</p>
    <p>
     Admirably, Chernow addresses common prejudices readers might bring to his subject by starting his book with this observation:</p>
    <blockquote>
     For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and
      other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and
      longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton,
      who had been condemned to everlasting silence.
