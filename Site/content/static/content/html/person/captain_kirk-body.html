     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>,<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
      representing the personality of James T. Kirk, Captain of
      the Starship Enterprise on
      the Original Star Trek series.

    <p>
     Kirk is the main character on the show, and almost all
      of the episodes revolve around him.

     Kirk and Spock's similarity makes sense, though, when you consider the
      duties performed by all three characters on the starship.

     While Kirk and Spock's posts are on the bridge and involve working with
      the entire ship, McCoy's work as medical officer involves working
      exclusively with people.

     By frequently consulting with McCoy when he faces a tough decision,
      Kirk shows he is truly wise.
