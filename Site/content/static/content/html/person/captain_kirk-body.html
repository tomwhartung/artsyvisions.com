     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     It depicts the personality of James T. Kirk, Captain of
      the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk is the main character on the show, and almost all
      of the episodes revolve around
      him..<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Archetypal Leader</h4>
    <p>
     The Green and Red in Kirk's portrait show he is decisive, and
      decisiveness is an important quality in a leader.
     Aliens frequently threaten the starship, and these threats often come
      with a deadline &mdash; some sort of ticking clock.
     In these situations, it is essential for the leader to keep calm,
      because indecisiveness can be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk's image also contains a bit of Yellow, showing he is
      pragmatic.
     Pragmatism is another important quality in a leader, because it helps
      ensure a crew's loyalty when they can also see for themselves
      the situations driving their leader's decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk enjoys being the one making the decisions.
     In episode 12 of season 3,
      <span class="episode-title">The Empath</span>,
      he, Spock, and McCoy are trapped underground on a planet.
     They become the subject of some cruel experiments by some aliens and,
      even though he is under stress and in pain,
      Kirk manages to find the energy to state
      <q>The decision is mine.  If there are any decisions to be made,
        I'll make them. if and when it becomes necessary.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Logical but in Touch With His Emotions</h4>
    <p>
     Green dominates the image, showing the Captain prefers to make
      logical decisions.
     But there is also plenty of Red, showing he is in touch with his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk repeatedly demonstrates a preference for rationality.
     He demonstrates repeatedly how he is able to stay calm in the battles
      he faces, whether on the bridge of the starship or
      in hand-to-hand combat with an alien in an arena.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is also worth noting that he rarely shows emotions.
     doesn't even cry when his brother dies.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he is also in touch with his emotions.
     For example, in the episode The Conscience of the King....
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic but Imaginative</h4>
    <p>
     Jim is pragmatic.
     He is not in some ivory tower, he is on the front lines, battling aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he is also imaginative.
     For example, in the episode The Corbonite Maneuver....
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Heading Level h4</h4>
    <p>
     While Kirk and Spock's posts are on the bridge and involve working with
      the entire ship, McCoy's work as medical officer involves working
      exclusively with people.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By frequently consulting with McCoy when he faces a tough decision,
      Kirk shows he is truly wise.
    </p>

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     This portrait is based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
