     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     It depicts the personality of James T. Kirk, Captain of
      the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk is the main character on the show, and almost all
      of the episodes revolve around
      him..<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Archetypal Leader</h4>
    <p>
     The Green and Red in Kirk's portrait show he is decisive, and
      decisiveness is an important quality in a leader.
     Aliens frequently threaten the starship, and these threats often come
      with a deadline &mdash; some sort of ticking clock.
     In these situations, it is essential for the leader to keep calm,
      because indecisiveness can be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk's image also contains a bit of Yellow, showing he is
      pragmatic.
     Pragmatism is another important quality in a leader, because it helps
      ensure a crew's loyalty when they can also see for themselves
      the situations driving their leader's decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk enjoys being the one making the decisions.
     In episode 12 of season 3,
      <span class="episode-title">The Empath</span>,
      he, Spock, and McCoy are trapped underground on a planet.
     They become the subject of some cruel experiments by some aliens and,
      even though he is under stress and in pain,
      Kirk manages to find the energy to state
      <q class="dialog">The decision is mine.  If there are any decisions to be made,
       I'll make them. if and when it becomes necessary.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Logical but in Touch With His Emotions</h4>
    <p>
     Green dominates the image, showing the Captain prefers to make
      logical decisions.
     But there is also plenty of Red, showing he is in touch with his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk repeatedly demonstrates a preference for rationality.
     For one thing, he is able to stay calm in all of the battles
      he faces, whether on the bridge of the starship or
      in hand-to-hand combat with an alien in an arena.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interestingly, Kirk simply doesn't cry, even when confronted with
      great personal loss.
     In season 1 episode 15,
      <span class="episode-title">Shore Leave</span>,
      his <q class="dialog">personal friend</q> dies, yet Kirk shows no emotion.
     When a Yeoman gets upset and blames herself, he reprimands her:
      <q class="dialog">Yeoman!  We're in trouble.
       I need every crewman alert and thinking.</q>
     This happens again in season 1 episode 29,
      <span class="episode-title">Operation &mdash; Annihilate!</span>
     Kirk sees his own brother die, yet he still refuses to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously, Kirk felt crying would be a sign of weakness,
      an unacceptable trait in a starship captain.
     It's also obvious he understands how emotions are extremely important.
    </p>
    <p>
     This awareness of the importance of emotions is most evident in a
      comment he makes in season 1 episode 13,
      <span class="episode-title">The Conscience of the King</span>.
     Thinking out loud while trying to decide whether an actor could
      actually be a criminal on the run, he states:
      <q>He could've changed his appearance.  No.  Logic is not enough.
       I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk also shows his more human, emotional side in his encounters
      with beautiful women.
     Unlike the totally unemotional Spock, Kirk never has any difficulty
      turning on the charm.
     Finally, by frequently consulting with the emotional McCoy when he
      faces a tough decision, Kirk further demonstrates his awareness of
      the need for balanced decision-making.
    </p>

    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic but Imaginative</h4>
    <p>
     Jim is pragmatic.
     He is not in some ivory tower, he is on the front lines, battling aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he is also imaginative.
     For example, in the episode The Corbonite Maneuver....
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Heading Level h4</h4>
    <p>
     While Kirk and Spock's posts are on the bridge and involve working with
      the entire ship, McCoy's work as medical officer involves working
      exclusively with people.

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     This portrait is based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
