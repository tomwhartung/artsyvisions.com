     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     It depicts the personality of James T. Kirk, Captain of
      the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk is the main character on the show, and almost all
      of the episodes revolve around
      him..<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">An Archetypal Leader</h4>
    <p>
     The Green and Red in Kirk's portrait show he is decisive, and
      decisiveness is an important quality in a leader.
     Aliens frequently threaten the starship, and these threats often come
      with a deadline &mdash; some sort of ticking clock.
     In these situations, it is essential for the leader to keep calm,
      because indecisiveness can be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk's image also contains a bit of Yellow, showing he is
      pragmatic.
     Pragmatism is another important quality in a leader, because it helps
      ensure a crew's loyalty when they can also see for themselves
      the situations driving their leader's decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk enjoys being the one making the decisions.
     In episode 12 of season 3,
      <span class="episode-title">The Empath</span>,
      he, Spock, and McCoy are trapped underground on a planet.
     They become the subject of some cruel experiments by some aliens and,
      even though he is under stress and in pain,
      Kirk manages to find the energy to state
      <q class="dialog">The decision is mine.  If there are any decisions to be made,
       I'll make them. if and when it becomes necessary.</q>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Logical but Aware of His Emotions</h4>
    <p>
     Green dominates the image, showing the Captain prefers to make
      logical decisions.
     But there is also plenty of Red, showing he is in touch with his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk repeatedly demonstrates a preference for rationality.
     For one thing, he is able to stay calm in all of the battles
      he faces, whether on the bridge of the starship or
      in hand-to-hand combat with an alien in an arena.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interestingly, Kirk does not cry, even when confronted with
      great personal loss.
     In season 1 episode 15,
      <span class="episode-title">Shore Leave</span>,
      his <q class="dialog">personal friend</q> dies, yet Kirk shows no emotion.
     When a Yeoman gets upset and blames herself, he reprimands her:
      <q class="dialog">Yeoman!  We're in trouble.
       I need every crewman alert and thinking.</q>
     This happens again in season 1 episode 29,
      <span class="episode-title">Operation &mdash; Annihilate!</span>
     Kirk sees his own brother die, yet he still refuses to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously, Kirk knows crying is a sign of weakness,
      an unacceptable trait in a starship captain.
     It's also clear he understands how emotions are extremely important.
    </p>
    <p>
     This awareness of the importance of emotions is most evident in a
      comment he makes in season 1 episode 13,
      <span class="episode-title">The Conscience of the King</span>.
     Thinking out loud while trying to decide whether an actor could
      actually be a criminal on the run, he states:
      <q>He could've changed his appearance.  No.  Logic is not enough.
       I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk also shows his more human, emotional side in his encounters
      with beautiful women.
     Unlike the totally unemotional Spock, Kirk never has any difficulty
      turning on the charm.
     Finally, by frequently consulting with the emotional McCoy when he
      faces a tough decision, Kirk further demonstrates his awareness of
      the need for balanced decision-making.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic but Imaginative</h4>
    <p>
     As an explorer, James Kirk is very pragmatic and realistic.
     He spends his day not in some ivory tower, but on the front lines,
      interacting with &mdash; and all too frequently battling &mdash; aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Kirk's image has some bits of Blue in it, showing he can be
      imaginative, when the situation calls for it.
     For example, in season 1 episode 10,
      <span class="episode-title">The Corbomite Maneuver</span>,
      the ship is threatened with imminent destruction when Kirk
      is suddenly inspired by the card game poker.
     His quick thinking is definitely what one would call
      <q>outside of the box,</q> and it ultimately enables
      him to save the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Captain Kirk can come up with new ideas, it is usually in
      response to a critical demand or threat in the real world.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">A Respected Leader</h4>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk has the characteristics &mdash; ratiionality and
      realism, visualized as Green and Yellow &mdash; essential in a
      leader.
     He also knows how to temper these with a healthy respect for human
      emotions and the ability to think out of the box.
     One could even say that James T. Kirk is more passionate about his crew’s
      lives than he is about his own – and hence he is more than worthy of
      his crew’s respect and allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     These qualities enable him to bring together a team which is,
      by and large, invincible in their travels throughout the universe.
     And his team respects him as much for his archetypal leadership
      qualities as for his ability to temper them as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk is a fictional character, but he manifests many of the best
      qualities of people in general &mdash; and leaders in particular.
     Significantly, some of these qualities are outside the scope of
      the questionnaire used to produce the profiles these images depict,
      and thus do not appear in it.
     That is to say, this spiritual portrait does not tell the whole
      story &mdash; and the
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/'
         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Darth Vader on SeeOurMinds.com'
         target='_blank'>
       image of a <q class="slang">bad guy's</q> personality</a>
      might be similar &mdash; but it is useful as a starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a fictional character, Captain Kirk does not have human
      parents.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
     Instead, he is a product of the stories appearing since the 1920s
      in pulp fiction magazines such as
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DHf0yW">Amazing Stories</a>
      and
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2FoNzfh">
       The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     Captain Kirk may be make-believe, but he has very real human
      qualities &mdash; qualities ultimately inspired by real people.
     More importantly, Kirk has inspired not just the members of his
      fictional crew but countless numbers of real people since his
      inception in the mid-1960s.
     I for one have no doubt that his universal leadership qualities are
      a big part of the series' continuing popularity.

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     This portrait is based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered episodes include new special effects
      sequences, reworked using modern technology.
     The disks have an option enabling you to switch between the original
      and the updated effects sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after watching the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with a few of the writers for the
      series, including David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Watching the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
