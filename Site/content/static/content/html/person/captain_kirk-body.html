     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     It depicts the personality of James T. Kirk, Captain of
      the Starship Enterprise on the
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">Original Star Trek</a>
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk is the main character on the show, and almost all
      of the episodes revolve around
      him..<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Leader</h4>
    <p>
     Kirk's portrait shows he is decisive.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Heading Level h4</h4>
    <p>
     While Kirk and Spock's posts are on the bridge and involve working with
      the entire ship, McCoy's work as medical officer involves working
      exclusively with people.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Pragmatic but Imaginative</h4>
    <p>
     Jim is pragmatic.
     He is not in some ivory tower, he is on the front lines, battling aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he is also imaginative.
     For example, in the episode The Corbonite Maneuver....
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Logical but in Touch With His Emotions</h4>
    <p>
     Kirk is logical, staying calm in his battles.
     He doesn't even cry when his brother dies.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he is also in touch with his emotions.
     For example, in the episode The Conscience of the King....
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By frequently consulting with McCoy when he faces a tough decision,
      Kirk shows he is truly wise.

    <h4 class="center">Star Trek TOS on DVD</h4>
    <p>
     This portrait is based on
      the DVD box set containing all 79 episodes of
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DGX4EO"
         class="series-title">
       Star Trek: The Original Series</a>.
     Each episode has been digitally remastered, and the results are beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remastered disks include new special effects
      sequences, reworked with modern technology.
     The disks enable you to switch between the original and updated
      sequences while watching an episode.
     This unique feature is great fun to play with, but I did not fully
      appreciate it until after experiencing the commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
     As my good friends these days know, commentaries are one of my
      favorite features of watching any series or movie on DVD!
     I am a lifelong fan of
      <a href="https://www.Groja.com/about#backstory" target="_blank"
         title="Link to the backstory about spiritual portraits at Groja.com">
       art history</a>,
      and I love watching these and hearing the behind-the-scenes stories
      of any show!
    </p>
    <p>
     The special features include interviews with the people who worked on
      the special effects discussing the challenges they encountered,
      their priorities, and the compromises they had to make.
     The commentaries also include interviews with writers for the
      series, such as David Gerrold, who wrote
      <span class="episode-title">The Trouble With Tribbles</span>,
      and D. C. Fontana, Gene Roddenberry's secretary-turned-story editor and
      writer.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the special features always make me want to rewatch
      the episodes in light of the new information.
     As I write this, I am rewatching the series for the third time, and
      can say I have definitely gotten my money's worth in buying this box!
