     The image above is a spiritual portrait, or
      <em>Groja</em>.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[1]</a></sup>
     It depicts the personality of Thomas Jefferson, one of America's Founding Fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the third president of the United States of America,
      <a href='https://www.SeeOurMinds.com/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/'
         title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on SeeOurMinds.com' target='_blank'>
       Thomas Jefferson</a>
      was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Ideally: Liberty Without Anarchy</h4>
    <p>
     The vast amount of Blue in Jefferson's profile represents his
      strong preference for being idealistic.
     The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom,
      drafted by Jefferson in 1777, is an excellent example of this idealism.
    </p>
    <p>
     As this quote shows, Jefferson's idealism also enabled him to
      delineate the fine yet crucial distinction between too much
      liberty &mdash; total anarchy &mdash; and just enough:</p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is
      unobstructed action according to our will.
     But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within
      limits drawn around us by <b>the equal rights of others.</b>&nbsp;
     [Emphasis added.]
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson, in aLetter to Isaac H. Tiffany,
      April 4, 1819.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Jefferson's idealism helped make the transition to the United
      States' new and unique system of government, once independence
      from Britain was attained, relatively peaceful.
     In contrast, the transitions of some other countries since then &mdash;
      from France's Reign of Terror to more recent conflicts such as the
      Arab Spring &mdash; have been quite the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Americans are fortunate to have individuals such as
     Jefferson who are willing to express their ideals.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">Balancing Head and Heart</h4>
    <p>
     Thomas Jefferson's tendency to be more logical than passionate is
      visible in the image as Green.
     It is important to note this preference is very slight.
     Because his strongest preference is to
      be open-minded rather than decisive, it is difficult to
      see this in the image.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jefferson's ability to balance rational with emotional decision-making
      is most apparent in a letter he wrote to Maria Cosway
      in the spring of 1786.
     The letter articulates &mdash; in an extremely personal and revealing
      manner &mdash; the battle being fought in his mind between his head and his
      heart:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="avs-blockquote">
     Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head &amp; my Heart:
     <br>
     Head: Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.
     <br>
     Heart: I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings.  Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.
     <br>
     Head: These are the eternal consequences of your warmth &amp; precipitation.  This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us....
     <br>
     Heart: Oh, my friend! This is no moment to upbraid my foibles.  I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief! ....
     <br>
     Head: On the contrary I never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions....  Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer it....
     <br>
     Heart: Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings.  It was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it....
     <br>
     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Excerpts from <q class="document-title">My Head and My Heart,</q>
      a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, October 12,
      1786.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[2]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
					In this short passage, Thomas Jefferson
					 shows he took advantage of both decision-making techniques.
					This explains why some consider him an enigma
      in that he could declare <q class="from-book">all men are created equal</q>
      while owning slaves and even
      loving<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[3]</a></sup>
      at least one of them.
    </p>
    <h4 class="center">At Odds With Hamilton</h4>
    <p>
     The image of Thomas Jefferson's open and idealistic personality
      stands in stark constrast to the
      <a href='/visions/story/0060-person-alexander_hamilton'
         title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'
         target='_blank'>
       image of Alexander Hamilton</a>'s
      decisive, pragmatic persona.
     Although both had high hopes for their new nation,
      their backgrounds were as different as their personalities, and
      they disagreed about many things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside,
      envisioned a rural, agrarian society,
      Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in
      New York City, foresaw large, bustling cities.
     While the idealistic Jefferson thought the United States could remain
      neutral without a standing military, the pragmatic Hamilton knew this
      idea was dangerously unrealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people claim that Jefferson and Hamilton
      <q class="dialog">hated each
      other.</q><sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
     These spiritual portraits show that these two Founding Fathers
      were better than that.
     Hate is an emotion, and if Jefferson and Hamilton harbored
      contempt for each other, their portraits would have more Red.

       John Adams</a>,
      and other Founding Fathers may have been political rivals, but
      they were also predominantly logical people.
     Significantly, they may have disagreed over many things but they
      were all strongly united in their disdain for the sort of
      uncontrolled emotions that could fuel mob violence.
