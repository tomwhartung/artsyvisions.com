       title='Link to an article about how Jefferson is an enigma at www.pbs.org'
       target="_blank">
     article at www.pbs.org</a>
    discusses the <q class="from-document">DNA evidence presented in 1998
    linking Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.</q>
   Also interesting is the fact that Martha Jefferson &mdash; his first and
    only wife who died when she was just 33 &mdash;
    <q class="from-article">and Sally Hemings
    <a href="https://www.monticello.org/sallyhemings/?ref=home" target="_blank"
       title="Article about Sally Hemmings at www.monticello.org">
     are half-sisters</a>.</q>
   Thomas promised Martha that he would never re-marry.
   It's apparent that with Sally he found a way to compromise the pull between his
    Head and his Heart.
