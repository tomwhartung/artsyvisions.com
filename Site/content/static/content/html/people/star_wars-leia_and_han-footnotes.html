<p>ยน Grojas are Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.  Grojas are images composed of four primary colors, put into rectangular shapes, and they depict the essential personality functions everyone exhibits to at least some degree.  These personality functions are traits initially identified by Carl Jung in his writings about psychological types in the early 1920s, and more recently made popular by psychologists such as Isabel Myers Briggs and David Keirsey.
