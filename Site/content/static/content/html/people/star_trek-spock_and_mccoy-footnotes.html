<p>¹ Grojas are Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes. Inspired by the abstract art of Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky, Grojas seek to demonstrate harmony in rectangular shapes of opposing primary colors. The colors in the Grojas depict the pairs of opposing personality functions Carl Jung detailed in his writings about human psychological types in the early 1920s.  For more information about Wassily Kandinsky and Carl Jung’s personality types, consult the Wikipedia, SeeOurMinds.com, Groja.com, or your favorite search engine.</p>
