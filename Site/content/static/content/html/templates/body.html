     <h3 class="center">Temporarily Stashed From Fawlty Towers Article</h3>
     <h4 class="center">Unused Content</h4>
     <p>
      The contrast between Basil and Sybil’s personalities is just one of the
       aspects of the show that puts it in the #1 position on the BFI
       TV 100 – the list of the top 100 TV shows compiled by the British
       Film Institute in
       2000.<sup><a href="#notes" title="Skip to the Notes on this page">[4]</a></sup>
      Manuel's and Polly's unique personalities and solid contributions also
       help keep both the hotel running and the show entertaining.
     </p>
     <p>
      When things start getting difficult, the members of Team Fawlty
       start to shine.
      For example, in the second season's opening episode,
       <span class="episode-title">Communication Problems</span>,
       a grumpy customer who is hard of hearing quickly exasperates
       each member of the team, one by one.
     </p>
     <p>
      First Mrs. Richards insists on interrupting Polly while she is
       busy with another guest, so she refers the guest to Manuel.
      Try as he might, Manuel quickly finds her impossible to deal with
       and calls for Basil.
      Fortunately she is unable to hear most of his insensitive insults,
       and ultimately he fobs her off on Sybil.
      Even Sybil is able to reason with the grumpy guest when she finds
       she's missing some money.
     </p>
     <h4 class="center">Unused Descriptive Passages</h4>
     <p>
      The Yellow in Basil's portrait shows he can get bored easily, and the
       Green shows he's can be a schemer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Full of Red and Green, Sybil’s portrait stands in stark contrast to
       Basil’s.
      It reveals her confidence, decisiveness, and a need to control others,
       but she is willing to actually lift a finger and help out – albeit
       begrudgingly – during emergencies.
      The Red and Green in Sybil's image shows she's the decisive one
       in &mdash; and the real boss of &mdash; Team Fawlty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Blue in Polly's image shows she can be good at coming up with
       fresh ideas to help keep Basil from getting in trouble.
      Ostensibly a manual job, it turns out her duties are challenging both emotionally and intellectually — and Polly proves herself uniquely qualified for the role.
      The Red in her and Manuel's images show they're both amiable,
       and they show this by helping Basil when they can.
     </p>
     <p>
      A character with less openness — and with less Yellow and Blue in their portrait — would quickly leave this position for another.
      Manuel may be the low man on the Fawlty Towers totem pole, but he plays an important role.
      He's dedicated, hard working, and his character is
     </p>
     <p>
      Basil’s carelessness, haplessness, and bad luck never fail to get
       the best of him.
      Despite Sybil’s best efforts – or quite possibly because of them – he
       time and again fails to learn a lesson, and as a result, hilarity ensues.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sybil’s mantra is “I know, I know,” and she is too busy fussing with her
       hair and nails to care for any of Basil’s schemes.
      If only Basil would just obey her every demand, and not stray into
       his hare-brained schemes, the
       <span class="series-title">Fawlty Towers</span>
       universe would be perfect &mdash;
       and no doubt the show would be incredibly boring.

     Thinking about including a small copy of the image down in the text
