Guidelines for writing content for Artsy Visions stories.

## Overview

### Goals

The goal of these stories is to provide **content marketing.**

- Content marketing of books and videos - affiliate links
- Content marketing of the images - get your portrait at Groja.com

## Guidelines

Following are details applying to Step 3. Story and Notes in VISIONS-HOW_TO.md

**Note that each article may be the visitor's first exposure to the idea of visualizing a personality.**

### First Person

- Ok in Conclusion or Notes **only**
  - With extremely rare exceptions, maybe?
  - If "needed," add a note and put the "needed" first person phrase there

### Links

- Use minimal links
  - Save the wikipedia, imdb, youtube, and fan site links for the stories at SeeOurMinds.com
- Affiliate links
  - Use these exclusively, if at all possible
  - Unsure what these will look like at this time
- Links to Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com - certainly are acceptable
  - **Never duplicate any information already on Groja.com/about - always provide a link instead**
  - Remember the original image page at SeeOurMinds.com is the only place where they can see the score
  - Make adding affiliate links to the linked-to pages at SeeOurMinds.com a high priority

### Format and Content of Visions

- Use `html/templates/body.html` as a starting point

#### Introduction

**Always** open with general information.

- Remember, this may be the first one of these the visitor is seeing
  - There is no guarantee that they have even read the Groja.com/About page yet
- See the template for examples
- Keep it short, though
- The idea is, repeat visitors will learn to skip it

#### Overview

**What is the big picture revealed by the image or images?**

#### Context: Where and When

Set the scene, give the source of the character(s):

- Where they are from (real life, book, film, tv, etc.)
- Where they are now
- What they are doing now

#### Who the Image(s) Represent

Describe what the colors represent in PERSON 1, and give an example
[Describe what the colors represent in PERSON 2, and give an example]
[Describe what the colors represent in PERSON 3, and give an example]

#### People and Groups Only: Compare and Contrast

What do they have in common?
What makes them different from each other?
If they are related, what makes their relationship unique?
Is there anything else interesting and specific to this pair of images?

#### Conclusion

- What have we learned from this image or these images?
- This is probably where we should put the affiliate links.
- Ok to use first person here.

#### Notes

Notes appear in a separate file from the body.

- Use `html/templates/notes.html` as a starting point

**Always** include a brief initial note explaining the whole idea and providing a link for more information.

Add other notes as appropriate, e.g., for ideas that "need" to be expressed in the first person.
