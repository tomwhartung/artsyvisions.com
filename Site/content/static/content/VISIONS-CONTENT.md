Guidelines for writing content for Artsy Visions stories.

## Overview

### Goals

The goal of these stories is to provide **content marketing.**

- Content marketing of books and videos - affiliate links
- Content marketing of the images - get your portrait at Groja.com

## Guidelines

Following are details applying to Step 3. Story and Footnotes in VISIONS-HOW_TO.md

**Note that each article may be the visitor's first exposure to the idea of visualizing a personality.**

### First Person

- Ok in Conclusion or Footnotes **only**
  - With extremely rare exceptions, maybe?
  - If "needed," add a footnote and put the "needed" first person phrase there

### Links

- Use minimal links
  - Save the wikipedia, imdb, youtube, and fan site links for the stories at SeeOurMinds.com
- Affiliate links
  - Use these exclusively, if at all possible
  - Unsure what these will look like at this time
- Links to Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com - certainly are acceptable
  - **Never duplicate any information already on Groja.com/about - always provide a link instead**
  - Remember the original image page at SeeOurMinds.com is the only place where they can see the score
  - Make adding affiliate links to the linked-to pages at SeeOurMinds.com a high priority
