  "card_content_html": "<p>Captain Kirk's image shows he is decisive, out-going, practical, and cool under pressure.  These preferences are typical in leaders &mdash; but being a highly respected boss that people feel good about following takes a bit more.</p>",
  "card_first_person_html": "<p>The profiles and images of the three main characters in Star Trek were among the first I did back in the 1980s, so it makes sense they should be the first posted on this site.</p><p>Initially, it was a bit surprising to see how similar Captain Kirk's imge is to Mr. Spock's.  It's also interesting to see how these portraits show Kirk is more outgoing &mdash; one of the qualities which helps make him a good leader.</p>",
