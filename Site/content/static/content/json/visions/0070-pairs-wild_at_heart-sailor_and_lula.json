There's just one problem: Lula's mom, Marietta.</p><p>These images show that Sailor's and Lula's personalities are very similar.  Lula is more outgoing and emotional than he is, but they are both passionate and open to new experiences and ideas &mdash; they're both <span class='movie-title'>Wild at Heart.</span></p>",
  "card_first_person_html": "<p><span class='first-letter'>S</span>ailor and Lula's characters are not extremely well-developed in the film, but as a huge fan of David Lynch I thought I'd try drawing their spiritual portraits anyway.</p><p>As expected, the resultant images contain plenty of Red &mdash; representing their shared passion &mdash; but both images are overwhelmed by Yellow and Blue, representing their openness.  The couple has a lot of fun together, but the downside to having such open personalities is, Sailor and Lula do not make the best decisions.</p><p>What they lack in real life experience, they make up for in youthful energy.  It's conceivable they could make a happy couple despite their lack of direction &mdash; if it wasn't for Marietta.</p>",
