  "card_content_html": "<p>Mr. Spock's image shows he is very cool, logical, and decisive.  It stands in stark contrast to the warm image of the emotional Dr. McCoy.</p><p>These spiritual portraits show how McCoy's and Spock's differing temperaments cause them to frequently find themselves in conflict with one another.</p>",
  "card_first_person_html": "<p>The profiles and images of the three main characters in Star Trek were among the first I did back in the 1980s, so it makes sense they should be the first posted on this site.</p><p>In addition to showing the contrast between Spock's coolness and McCoy's warmth, the Doctor's image shows he is both more outgoing and open-minded than Spock.  These qualities help make him seem all that more <q>human</q> than the aloof and stubborn Spock.</p>",
