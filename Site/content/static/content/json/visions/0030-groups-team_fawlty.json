This versatility helps the small team take care of all of the duties required to run the hotel near England's southern coast.</p><p>In addition to showing they are all fairly well-rounded, these portraits also show each character has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Despite their differences, these four unique characters learn to work together and ultimately they form a diverse team.  Their diversity allows them to achieve amazing feats &mdash; even if making a Waldorf Salad is not one of them.</p>",

The Red and Green in Sybil's image shows she's the decisive one in &mdash; and the real boss of &mdash; Team Fawlty.</p><p>The Blue in Polly's image shows she can be good at coming up with fresh ideas to help keep Basil from getting in trouble.  The Red in her and Manuel's images show they're both amiable, and they show this by helping Basil when they can.</p>",
