The colors in these images illustrate the Jungian archetypes that form the basis of the four-letter types popularized by the MBTI&reg;.  The <b>Blue</b> in these spiritual portraits show that both of them tend to be <b>idealistic</b> in general &mdash; and <b>spiritual</b> in particular.  The <b>Red</b> represents their tendency to be <b>emotional</b> in general &mdash; and <b>people-oriented</b> in particular.</p>",
