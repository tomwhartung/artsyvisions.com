  "card_content_html": "<p><span class='first-letter'>A</span>merican TV shows in the 1960s were predominantly white.  When Gene Roddenberry created the Original Star Trek Series, he decided to change that.  The ostensibly diverse team on the bridge of the Enterprise broke new ground on the medium in 1966-1968, when changes in race relations in America were on the forefront of everyone's mind.</p>",
  "card_first_person_html": "<p><span class='first-letter'>O</span>n the surface, the crew on the bridge of the starship in the original series is fairly diverse.  Looking at their personalities, however, shows the main characters &mdash; with the exception of the extremely logical Mr. Spock, of course &mdash; are fairly <q>normal.</q>  Psychologically speaking, each character is quite well-suited for their role, and any claim that any one of them is out of place in their position is completely unfounded.</p>",
