Ultimately he was able to work with the other Founding Fathers and build a resilient government that nations throughout the world would come to emulate.</p><p>The ability of the United States to withstand tyranical politicians and crises such as the Civil War is largely due to the conscientious work of Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers.</p>",
