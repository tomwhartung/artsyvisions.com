There's just one problem: Lula's mom, Marietta Fortune.</p><p>These images show just how similar Sailor and Lula are under the surface.  Lula is more outgoing and emotional than he is, but they are both passionate and open to new experiences and ideas &mdash; they're both <span class='movie-title'>Wild at Heart.</span></p>",
  "card_first_person_html": "<p><span class='first-letter'>S</span>ailor and Lula's characters are not extremely well-developed in the film, but as a huge fan of David Lynch I thought I'd try drawing their spiritual portraits anyway.</p><p>As expected, the resultant images contain plenty of Red, representing their shared passion, but both images are overwhelmed by Yellow and Blue, representing their openness.  The couple has a lot of fun together, but the downside to having such open personalities is, Sailor and Lula do not make the best decisions.</p><p>Despite this, which is largely due to their lack of real life experience, they are full of youthful energy.  It's conceivable they could make a happy couple despite their lack of direction &mdash; if it wasn't for Lula's mom.</p>",
