# Setting RUNNING_LOCALLY does the following:
# - causes site to display grey boxes instead of ads
# - enables the tiny sized quiz (containing 4 questions for testing) option
# - turns on the django DEBUG option (in settings.py)
#   (this is NOT the same as DJANGO_DEBUG)
#
# Setting DJANGO_DEBUG does the following:
# - prints detailed information about how quizzes are scored
#
export DJANGO_DEBUG=1

#
#   When RUNNING_LOCALLY=1, the site includes visions from json/visions AND json/visions-drafts
#   When RUNNING_LOCALLY=0, the site includes visions from json/visions ONLY
#
export RUNNING_LOCALLY=0
## export RUNNING_LOCALLY=1
